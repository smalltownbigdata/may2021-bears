WL521 responded and observed bear scat and 8 chicken carcasses inside of a coup. WL521 set a bear trap adjacent to the coup. No blood,  drag marks or other sign of a dead or injured goat was located. RP agreed that the goats had probably run off while the bear was attacking the chickens. Goats had been in a fenced pen. WL521 advised RP that electric fencing would be the long term solution but RP stated,  ""the last guy said that but it's too expensive."" WL521 confirmed with both WL525 and WL524 that they had contacted the RP in the past and advised him that electric fencing would remedy the bear conflict occurring at the property.

Nicholson drove to property on 7/31 to remove trap. Upon 10:00am arrival, trap door was shut and Nicholson found an adult dark brown bear inside trap. RP had never called to advise Bear was in trap. Bear matches description of bear depredating and causing problems at neighboring  homes. RP said he believed it was same bear that depredated his livestock. RP said a smaller cinnamon colored bear is still hanging around and asked what Nicholson would do with it. Nicholson told RP he was not removing another bear from property and RP needed to construct an electric fence as he had been told in past by wildlife officers.  Nicholson gave RP handouts with  material lists and directions for building a proper electric fence to keep bears away from his livestock. RP said he would do so. 

Nicholson euthanized bear at CPW property. Bear was adult male, dark chocolate brown, about 200 lbs, had bird seed in stomach, had numerous size 7.5 and size 2 shot pellets in fat throughout body. Bear was skinned and seal #33685 affixed. Entered by Nicholson on 7/31/2020.",

Upon further questioning the RP stated that he went outside to see what his dogs were barking at. He saw his dogs near a bear, that was in a tree. He was scared his dogs were going to be attacked so he went to pull them back. As he got closer he felt like his life was in danger and he shot and killed the bear.

Contacted RP who told me a bear killed their chickens and knocked over their beehives.  RP told me it happened on Saturday, time unknown.  Conducted a site inspection, told them how to better secure their coop with electric fencing and brought them an apiary kit.

I did not feel comfortable setting a trap because of the amount of time that passed.  They are located next to a creek, are near the river, and are located in prime bear habitat.  I did not want to accidentally capture the wrong bear.  I have heard about several bears in the general area. RP was fine with me not setting a trap.

Told her to contact me immediately if it happens again.  Gave her my cell phone number.

Note-Time on the app is not correct.  We do not know at what time this happened.",

Bear came to property, got into chicken and duck enclosure, went into barn and killed a pig. RP shot at bear and missed.  The bear was not scared off., Mark reloaded his handgun then the bear dropped the 30 pound pig which was eviscerated but still alive. Mark put the pig down and bear went off into the Oak brush. The RP states they have seen 4 bears around. Including a sow with 2 cubs. Told Rp to fortify the pig shed for remaining 2 pigs and food, use electricity. Gave rubber buck to Mark. Set a trap on 6/8 with camera. Captured bear in trap on 6/11/2020.",

Wildlife Officer Rocksund received a phone. All from CSP about a Sow and her two cubs inside a garage getting frozen food out of the freezer. WLOs Westbrook and Doyle responded and saw the bears searching for open garages in the neighborhood. WLO Westbrook approached the bears and activated his arch switch in his taser to haze the bears, they were weary of WLO Westbrook and left the scene. WLO Westbrook talked to the party with the open garage and they stated that they did not mean to leave their garage open on purpose and they are aware of the bears in their neighborhood and ways to haze them away.  -WLO 549",

WLO talked to the reporting party who had received a text that was a few hours old from a coworker who was side to have seen an injured bear.  WLO 523 attempted to reach the original individual involved, however they were still not in cell service.  WLO gathered what limited information was available and headed that direction.  However, before reaching the trailhead WLO 523 was called to assist Park County Sheriff's Office and CSP with a roll over accident at Terreyall Reservoir.
WLO 522 and WLO 521 where both made aware of the report. 
On Sunday the 19th an email was sent to CPW (ask a question page) from one of the hikers original involved.
On Monday the 20th this information was passed along to WLO 523.  WLO 523 then contacted the original patient and was able to follow-up on the report.

During the phone conversation WLO was informed of the following information from Samantha Condron.
On Saturday the 18th four parties parked at the Rock Creek parking  areas along USFS road 133.  From this location they could hear what they thought was an injured donkey or possibly a injured bear.  It was ""roaring"" (or actually likely bellowing) and although they stated they were scared they decided to hike in on the Colorado Trail to the Ben-Tyler trail in an attempt to locate and render aid to this injured animal.  The RP was very worried that some animal was very sick or injured as she explained that the trail was covered with ""fresh diarrhea"" and it seemed clear to her that this animal was in a great deal of pain from the sounds she heard.  They continued down the Ben-Tyler trail and about 100 yards after the hopped over a log in the trail.  It was at about this point when they contacted two other hikers who were running down the trail and who claimed that they too had heard the noise and went to investigate.  These other hikers explained that they had just seen a large black bear in the bushes and that it had run at them and they saw the teeth of the bear big.
Following this the entire group, which now include both hiking parties and now totalled 6 people, all ran the entire way back to the parking area.

WLO was able to clarify that Samantha had not personally seen, nor had anyone in her hiking party, the suspected bear i  question.  Furthermore, they only suspected it was injured or sick based solely upon the sounds they heard and the diarrhea they had seen on the trail.  And finally, that they had believed it to be the sounds of a bear (as had the other hiking party) while still in the parking lot before they had even started to hike in.  This assumption was further validated when they had come in contact with other scared hikers who were running down the trail.

WLO 523 felt rather confident that he had a good idea what had occurred, nevertheless, after talking with the RP he drove to the Rock Creek parking lot and attempted to retrace the path taken and collecte physical evidence of what had actually occurred on the 18th.

WLO 523 easily followed the Colorado Trail to the intersection with the  Ben-Tyler tail.  Along the way he to observed diarrhea in the trail, see photos.   He also passed the animals from which had been responsible for leaving this in the trail.  It should be noted that they were indeed large and black in color, see additional photos.  He continues along the trail and came to the log and crossed it and continued to approximately where the interaction occurred.  Here again there was plenty of sign left in and along  the trail.  Feeling confident in his findings and initial assessment of the situation WLO 523 returned to the parking area.  Although he had planned to post a warning sign at the trail head, alerting hikers to bear activity in the area the sign was not posted because there had not been any physical evidence to support the claim that a bear had been in the area a few days prior.  
Rather this was verly likley a case of mistaken identity.  
This would be best referred it biologist's terms as... BOVINE URSUS PRETENDUS!",

The trash can is a bear resistant style trash can but the bear was still able to gain access into it both times.

A pepper barrel was set next to the trash cans and  Deborah was encouraged to strap these cans to a poster tree to keep them in an upright position which will further help deny access into them if and when the bear returns.

A trail camera was also set on a tree at that location to get a photo of the bear if it returns.

Pepper barrel and camera were removed on June 22nd by WLO523.  It did not appear as though the bear had returned in the meantime.",

The dumpster is two doors down from RPs property. The bear bent the bear bars and sheared the heavy duty lock. They have tried different techniques to deter the bear. Unfortunately their trash service's head quarters is in the canyon, they are evacuated due to the fire and they are not answering their phones to help/reinforce the dumpster. 

The community volunteered to try not to dispose of their trash in the dumpster for a short period of time. This was effective until one member forgot and the bear came back. They have poured ammonia in the dumpster and soaked rags. This was also effective until the rags dried out and it returned again. 

I encouraged continuing these efforts, resoaking those rags regularly, potentially storing trash indoors until morning of pick up. I also sent educational materials. 

Bear got into trash can again on 10/5 and broke the dumpster trash lock. RP was given more deterrent advice and 186 was contacted for possible follow-up.

WL 186 had a site visit with Vanessa regarding the bear getting into the Dumpster on 10/10. He also issued Vanessa five rounds of beanbag rounds to help haze the bear. WL 186 also contacted Canyon utilities to have them replace the dumpster with a more bear proof dumpster. The new dumpster should arrive on site in the next week and a half.",

WL 261 contacted the RP and the RP stated that a few night ago a bear got into their trash. While picking up the trash that same night the bear returned and paced back and forth with its head down about 30 yards away. The trash was moved into the back enclosed porch of the house. On 08/24/2020 the bear returned and this time got into dog food which was left outside by the RP's roommate. The bear then got onto the back porch and looked through the window where the trash had been relocated too. WL 261 educated the RP and his roommate on the importance of removing all bear attractants from the outside of the house. The RP was also concerned that the bear could still smell the trash even though it was relocated in the house WL 261 suggested using rags soaked in ammonia in order to mask the smell and deter the bear. WL 261 also educated the RP on how to make unwelcome mats as a possible deterrent. During the site visit on 08/25/2020 WL 261 also gave the RP rubber slugs to have the bear if he saw it again.,

Mr. Brown had located the remains of five of his chickens that morning.  Mr. Brown also stated that they had a similar problem about a week prior and had lost about half a dozen birds during the evening... some of which had been eaten and others had just been injured really badly and needed to be dispatched.

WLO 523 responded and meet with R  Brown.  He was shown the checken coop.  There he was able to locate what appeared to be black colored bear hair on the entrance to the coop.  Also,the exterior fence had been forced over and muddy slide marks could be seen on the top rail and the wires where one or possibly two bears had gained access into and out of the coop/yard.

The Browns plan to build a better coop and yard here in the next few weeks before they get another batch of chickens.  WLO 523 offered to help with ideas on how to construct the coop and yard as well as offered to temporary loan them a electronical fence generator that could be used to build an additional electronic fence and unwelcome mats to help  protect the future chickens.
Also a pepper barrel was placed in the chicken yard until a later time to act as a  deterant until the new fence, yard/run, and coop cold be built.

Pepper barrel was removed by WLO523 on 11/14_20.
Improvements have been made to the chicken coop and electric fencing has been added.",

The bear has been getting into this dumpster on and off for months. Apparently the dumpster behind the Pizza Hut and other food places in the strip mall to the north of the drainage has been doing good until recently of keeping the dumpster closed and locked, but now the bear has been getting into it again. The bear likes to hang out in the culvert near the dumpster.

WL283 talked with workers inside the Pizza Hut and was given a memo that was sent out by the property owner (see the memo in the pictures). The property owner is aware of the bear and has advised its tenants to keep the dumpster closed. The Pizza Hut workers stated that at one point the property manager had been talking about getting a new dumpster. 

WL283 decided to make one more pass by the dumpster before he left and encountered the bear in the drainage ditch. WL283 hazed the bear with 2 rubber buckshot rounds. The bear ran up into the culvert that goes about a mile back under the street.

WL283 can follow up with the property manager tomorrow unless WL287 wants to.",

The bear was not scared of the loud noises or human presence.  The RP fired 2 rounds of rubber slugs at the bear, hitting it both times.  The bear did not run away, merely circled around the driveway the stayed nearby in the brush.  The RP and other neighbors are concerned about the bears behavior and lack of fear towards humans and dogs.  Another neighbor had reported that this same bear broke into another neighbors topper on his truck that same night.  There was no other information given as to who or where the break in occurred.

RP called to report that there was a bear in a tree in her backyard. The RP came home from a hike and walked out onto her back porch and heard noise coming from a large tree behind her house. When she looked into the tree she saw a large bear in the tree. When she called NERO it was still in the tree and the RP had gone in her house and was watching the bear. I told the RP to remain in the house and bring in any pets as well. The RP's property backs up to a open space with a creek and she thinks that the bear was using that creek bed as a way of getting around the area. WO546 was contacted and given the RP's information and location of the bear. LB

Bear had been previously tagged. Had been moved out of the metro area from Bowles  And Platte Canyon back in 2017.  Bear was tranquilized out of tree and taken off site and euthanized.

RP called to report that one of her beehives and her trashcans had been knocked over last night. The RP did not see a bear but her neighbors told her they had been a bear in the area before. The RP woke up around 5:30 this morning and looked out her window and saw trash all over her yard and one of her beehives knocked over. The RP thinks that, based on the number of bees on the ground, the bear might have been stung enough to be scared off. The RP says that her hives are more of a hobby and she rarely ever sells the honey. I told the RP that since the bear was rewarded, she should take precautions such as placing her trashcans inside and setting up an electric fence. The RP says the trashcans are already in her garage and that she was interested in an electric fence. I sent her the bear brochure information by email and also suggested using rags soaked in ammonia as another barrier. I contacted WO541 who said he would call the RP but since he is unable to actually visit the RP, the on call officer, WO548, was called and left a message. LB
Contacted RP on 7/16/20 and discussed her apiary situation. There was minimal damage to the beehive, and she has eight total hives and a small commercial connection with her honey and wax business. She met the qualifications for game damage fencing, and a 20‘ x 20‘ apiary fence was delivered on July 17, 2020. The RP also took additional mitigation measures and will continue to eliminate attractants on their property. J Olson #088",

Rick said this cabin is mainly a weekend cabin and his nephew, Zach, was visiting this weekend and when he showed up on Friday he found one door open and a mess of trash on the inside from a bear. Over the course of the weekend, he sighted the bear 4 times and then on Monday morning the bear made another attempt but was unsuccessful. Zach went and got a new lock for the door to prevent further break-in (hopefully). I went over hazing the bear with an air horn, the car alarm, bear spray, rubber buck, or a paintball gun. Also told him about making bear unwelcome mats for the windows or doors. He said he was warry about bringing the trash inside in case the bear tries to break in while someone is there and I told him if they don't, then they should put ammonia-soaked rags on the trash to help hide the smell. When I asked he said he did not have bird feeders out, but then Rick sent me a video of the bear and you could see hummingbird feeders on the porch. I emailed him back and told them to take those down too. KLeCavalier

On June 23, after attempting to contact Mr. Foster on the phone WLO523 responded to the address and arrived at the locked gate leading to the property at 4:37 pm.
On the evening on June 26th, Mr. Foster returned the phone call and spoke with WLO523 about the bear issue.
On June 27th WLO523 was able to contact family members at the cabin and set a pepper barrel at that time.  WLO523 spoke to them about the bear and how to remove other bear attractants as well as how to improve the unwelcome mat that they had constructed.  They also talked about fish improvement projects on the property and whatnot.
The pepper barrel should remain for a week or two and then be removed.
Pepper barrel was removed by WLO 523 and at that time he also met with additional members of the family who stated that the bear has not been seen on the property again in a while.

Reports that the bear returned to the property and attempted to again gain entry into the home were made.
WLO 523 again responded and meet with the new family members who were staying at the cabin at this point and replaced the pepper barrel as well as set up a trail camera.

Photos on the trail camera indicated th return of  bear on the evening of the 23rd and 26th both at about 8:30pm.  It appeared as though the bear might have been sprayed by the pepper barrel on the nightnof the 23rd.
A quick inspection of the property on the 28th indicated that it was likely a bear had gained entry into a shed near the home and had feed on both bird seed and fish pellets.
This information was then passed on to Mr. Foster.",

She stated that she works for several bed and breakfasts in Garfield and one of the ones she works for has home security cameras that video taped an injured bear the night before.  She stated that it had an injured back leg and she shared the video with WL 261.  After watching the video WL 261 believed that the injury was not life threatening to the bear. The RP told WL 261 that neighbors in the area have told her that the bear is tipping over their garbage at night, but she has not had any issues with that so far. WL 261 educated the RP on putting away bear attractants at night at all of her places of work, and offered Rubber Buckshot to haze the bear if it was seen by the RP again. The RP stated that she did not have a 12 gauge shotgun, but stated that she would ask her neighbors if they did so that WL 261 could get them some Rubber Buckshot.

The RP informed WL 261 that the bear was seen again on camera  on 08/01/2020.

On 08/05/2020 the RP (homeowner who lives out of state) text WL 261 that the bear had been back on the back porch of the residence and got into a cooler of ice that the guests of the residence have left out. WL 261 asked the RP if she informs guests of her house about bringing in food and bear attractants at night when renting the residence and she stated that she does and that it is in the rental agreement. WL 261 emailed the RP bear education fliers about bear proofing a house and living with bears to email to each renter that she has. The RP agreed to send them out. On 08/06/2020 WL 261 went to the property in an attempt to haze the bear but the bear was not seen in between the times of 1:00 AM - 1:45 AM, the time the RP stated the bear comes around.  

On 08/09/2020 the RP text WL 261 again stating that on 08/06/2020 the bear returned and was on the back porch again but the guests had removed the cooler and the bear did not get into anything. That same night the bear also dug a hole under the front porch. WL 261 will again try to haze the bear on 08/11/2020 when no guests are present in the residence so that he can be on the property for a prolonged amount of time.",

She yelled thinking it was her kids. She then discovered the screen was ripped out of the window and clear bear paw prints in the kitchen. Bear had left out of the window before she saw it. Home was occupied by the RP and two small children at the time. 

WL 527 responded and set the culvert trap from Staunton on 7/22. Bear is small in size. Pictures of  prints are attached. WALTER

On the evening of July 25th at about 9:30 p.m. WLO523 was notified that a bear had been caught in the cage trap.
 Unfortunately upon arrival it was determined that this was not the target bear associated with entering the home but rather a large bore with two green ear tags number 1083.  It appeared to be in good health and had a black colored coat 
WLO 523 was able to determine that this bear had been captured in area 5 the year prior... also as a none target bear.  Thus, this bear was taken a short ways out of town and released and hit with pepper spray as it left the trap.
The trap was cleaned out but not reset at the above address at this time.",

Two days ago it came back at apx. 8:30 PM and lifted the garage door, got inside and dragged out a 30 pound container of cat food. He saw it leaving and went outside and yelled at it, chasing it up a tree. He continued to yell but the bear came down the tree and came uphill towards him to retrieve the cat food. He fired a 12 ga slug into the ground near the bear and the bear finally walked off down the hill. Bear had also got into an open window on his truck to get a partial bag of sunflower seeds RP was eating, apparently before it got into the garage.

Advised to keep all vehicles clean of smells and foodstuffs and to lock. Told him to secure garage door and he found a large C-Clamp that he was going to use to secure the door from the inside. Told him about freezing meat scraps and to bleach the garbage can after emptying and after putting trash in. Told him to make up some rattle cans and to haze bear when it came back. Issued rubber buck and a rubber slug and said to shoot bear if it came in range on his property and to call if he needed more rounds.

Advised him to let me know if bear tries to get into garage again and I could set electric mat in front of door.

RP was very cooperative and said he would do everything he could to prevent further interaction. He did not want bear destroyed",

RP stated that he has been dealing with this black sub-adult bear for several weeks and has left messages for WLO 523 (1 requesting rubber buck) and today left messages for WLO 523 and 520 to call him.  The bear killed 5 chickens late last night (not commercial operation) and broke thru the bear boards on the top of the pen.  Hutch is still intact.  He fired warning shots and the pen is not electrified.  I suggested he consider electrifying and checking for rubber buck at a farm and ranch store.  He said he didn't need a bear packet.

I did ask him what he intends to do when the bear returns this evening if we aren't able to set a trap and he said he has a 700 mag.  Also stated he is a retired sheriff deputy and knows both Mark and Dawson.  T.Wallace NERO

WLO523 responded to the property on the evening of 07/09/2020 after finishing up his mandatory training that day.  WLO523 set a trap and planned to remove the bear and do a hard release with the aid of a K9 in Area1.
The trap remained until the late afternoon on the 13th of July.  A bear that meet the discretion had been caught in a cage trap after entering an occupied house just a short distance from the RP's address.  It is likely that these are both the same bears and thus the trap was removed from 670 Lair Lane.",

Went to the RP's residence and went over bear aware practices.  The RP had lots of humming bird feeders, bird seed feeders, empty bird seed bags and bird baths around her residence.  She also had a deer skull and vertebrae which she found while hiking in her backyard.  

Told the RP she needed to remove all the bird feeders and bird baths.  Also told her she needed to keep her car windows rolled up and vehicle doors locked.  Also told her to close and lock her doors when she leaves her house.  Also told her to not leave windows open and that she needed to close her doors when she leaves her residence.  I also told her she needed to close a ground level window she leaves open for ventilation (she lives in an earth ship style house).  I took the deer skeleton to aid in not attracting the bear to her residence.

She did not know the time the bear entered her car.",

Early morning on September 15 Officer McKee received a call from Eric and his wife, through CSP.  Eric stated that the bear was on their second story deck and told CSP he would shoot it.  Officer Mckee called and spoke with Eric and his wife. Eric stated he had put the feeders back out but had removed them at 7 o’clock that evening.  Officer Mckee advised him that residual seed and scent would  still bring bears in and that’s why he was instructed to remove feeders for the season.  He was instructed on how to haze the bear away and Officer McKee remained on the line until the bear was gone.
Officer McKee visited later that day and issued them a written warning for failure to remove attractants.  They stated the encounter on their porch was terrifying and understood the gravity of attractants and said they would not place feeders out again between May and November.
They were provided additional bear literature.

Bear has RED 8241 ear tags.  Bear is not aggressive at all but came up behind RP when he was grilling but he was able to scare it off.  RP says bear is small about lab size.  RP concerned since he has a 2 and 4 year old and doesn't want the bear to come upon the kids.  RP does not have any bird feeders, dog food etc, just the grill.  I told him to power wash or clean up the grill as much as he possibly could and then spray either a bleach solution or ammonia solution on the grill itself and the ground around it.  Party is very willing to do that.  He's just concerned about when he's grilling again what he should do.  He would like a call back.  KH-HSS
Spoke with RP. He advised bear does not run away when the drive up to it. I asked if he walked up to and he advised he did and it ran away. RP is building a house up there and present on weekends only. Asked him to call this weekend and I would provide bean bag rounds to him. WL 482",

WL 261 contacted the RP. The RP stated that on that earlier the day of the incident they had seen a bear in the area, but after it noticed the party it walked off. Later that night at around dusk, 8 individuals and 7 dogs were sitting in a circle conversing. At this time the RP heard her dog start to growl and head twigs breaking near her tent where her child was sleeping. The RP at this point rushed over to the tent where she saw a bear standing on its hind legs with a paw on the top of the tent. The RP immediately began screaming and chased the bear away. The bear did rip a portion of the tent, but the child was not injured. WL 261 asked the RP if there were any attractants in the tent or anything with any strong odor. The RP stated that there was not because they had read the signs about the area being bear country when they entered the area, but she thought that maybe the sweet odor of the laundry detergent could have something to do with it. WL 261 gave the party some information on camping in bear country and gave her some advice for a backpacking trip she was going to be taking with her family in the near future. He also stressed the importance of contacting CPW as soon as possible after an event like this, so that CPW could employ best wildlife practices. The RP stated that she would, but they didn't want anything to happen to the bear so they were reluctant to say anything. 

After contact with the RP WL 261 looked at the email string where he was informed of the incident and discovered that the original email was created on 06/15/2020, but by the time it made its way through the Forest Service ranks and forwarded to WL 261 it was 06/24/2020.",

Said that the bear had gotten into a roll-off trash container that was there from construction. The bear had also gotten into some trash that someone at a campground had left out. WL544 asked if there was any way to clean up the trash going into the roll off and make sure that it was only construction materials. RP said the roll-off was being removed. WL544 suggested that jelly stone continues to push education materials to incoming campers and to keep WL544 updated if events continue. WL544 also suggested hazing the bears with loud noise and making sure that they were not welcome in the campground. RP said that they would continue to do that and that the bears had not really been though the campground yet just on the outskirts of the west side. WL544 asked how many bears were around and RP said that he believed there were three different bears. 
END

On August 20th, 2020 Eric called to report that he was having issues with the bears again. They are getting around the bear-proof dumpsters and the enclosures.

On September 1st Jellystone notifies WL544 that they had chased a bear out of one of their dumpsters. The RP stated that the bear then climbed a tree and was sitting in the tree making huffing noises. This occurred at 1:37 am.  WL544 advises that they should leave the bear alone now that they hazed it and give it the chance to move on. An hour later the park staff was escorting someone to their campsite. RP noticed that the bear had left the tree and was now back on the ground. RP stated the bear followed the golf cart at a slight jog for a little bit. RP also noticed the bear was huffing. RP said that they felt the bear was irritated because they kept hazing it away.

On September 2nd at around 10 pm WL544 observed a bear on a dumpster. WL544 shot this bear with a taser to haze it away from the dumpster. The bear took a full 5-second ride and then ran off into the woods. WL544 saw the bear running down the fence line. WL544 then grabbed his paintball gun to Mark the bear. The bear then climbed a ponderosa pine tree. WL544 shot the bear with permeant orange paint on its hind end while one of the park rangers held a flashlight on it.

On September 3rd at 3 pm one of the rangers for the larkspur campground called to report an incident with a bear. The ranger stated that he was coming down the hill towards the activities dumpster and saw 3-4 bags of trash on the ground . The ranger stopped to pick the trash up. The ranger heard a huffing noise. the ranger then saw a large black bear with what was described as a gingerish marking behind the left ear. Ranger also stated the bear was marked with orange on the rear. The ranger then stated that he got back in the golf cart and drove away. The ranger stated that he felt something brush the back of his leg. The ranger was not sure what brushed the back of his leg. The ranger went back to the area later on at 3:45 and the bear was no longer in the area. WL544 took a statment for the ranger. WL544 placed signs in the area that this occurred letting people know there is bear activity in the area. WL544 also stayed out overnight to try and observe the specific bears behavior. WL544 did not observe that specific bear but did observe a different bear that ran when WL544 approached. Jellystone campground is in the process of educating campers and switching out all non bear proof dumpster to ones sufficient to keep bears out. Rangers are also currently going around and telling campers that they need to lock up food sources at night.

I looked around and found bear poop on the property so it is  plausible that a bear tried to enter the goat pen.  The electric fence most likely did it’s job and the bear left without getting in.  There are parts of the pen and chicken coop that are not electrified and I recommended that they electrify that section.  There was a pallet of grower feed outside the electric fence and I recommended that be stored inside the electrified area.  Gave her a Living with Bears pamphlet for further recommendations on how to minimize conflicts with bears.  Asked RP to call if she had anymore problems with the bear.  I performed the site inspection on 7-28-2020 but the app on my cell phone was not working hence the reason for entering the information a day later.,

At that time a ""large, brown bear"" ran at him and swiped him with her paw, hitting him in his right arm, causing several cuts.  Robinowitz separated himself from the bear and then she charged a second time but did not make contact with him.  Robinowitz was able to safely get himself and his dog inside the house then had his wife drive him to the hospital where he received a couple stiches and was released.  The bear was found in the tree outside Robinowitz's back door with two cubs.  The sow was euthanized and the two cubs were relocated to a rehab center.

WL 287 believes there in not an abandoned cub, as  a cub was found shot  in a near by neighborhood on 09/24/2020. This cub was distinct due to an ear missing.  The RP had multiple videos of the family playing in her pond. Videos show the sow with two cubs, one having a missing ear. 

 Both the sow and the cub were facing uphill and had blood coming from their noses.  They had most likely died sometime the previous day.  WL 287 and 288 looked for trauma and could not find any.  The metal detector was unable to locate  metal. 

The RP had mouse bait in 4 mouse trap containers, \.  The bears did not get into these. 

Both bears are being sent to the health lab.",

Connie and her husband were outside doing chores when one of their dogs started barking and headed toward the goat pen. The husband followed the dog and then saw a bear eating one of their goats. The dog kept going towards the bear and then the bear started walking towards the dog and husband. Connie called CPW and notified that there was a bear actively eating her goat.  WLO's 549, 548 and 544 were all about 30 minutes out, but headed to the residence to make an attempt to haze the bear. Castle Rock Animal Control arrived and kept the residents inside the house until WLO 549 arrived around 2pm. The bear was no longer at the residence when they arrived and they could not haze the bear. WLO 549 noticed that the backyard had chickens running around  and an apiary that was behind electric fence. Connie told WLO 549 that they have had issues with bears for 3 years and have electrified the fence around their hives and chicken coop. They also had a radio and motion sensor lights around those fences. There was no electric fence around the goat pen and it was at the back of the property. 
The property is covered by oak brush, plum and choke cherry bushes. WLO told Connie that her backyard still has a lot of attractants for bears and that they need to clean up all attractants. The goat that was not eaten was put in the chicken coop and Connie said they will be taking it to their property in Kiowa. WLO let Connie know that they can shoot the bear if it is actively pursuing her livestock or putting human lives in danger. Connie was told to haze the bear with loud noises and was given bear spray.  Connie will notify WLO 549 if bear returns.

Krall contacted the neighboring Lutheran Camp who told him that they had also had the bear get into an empty freezer and an outside gear area.  Krall also received a report from campers in the neighboring Lake Creek campground that the bear got into an empty cooler that had food in it earlier.  All parties said the bear was not aggressive, but it was not afraid either.  Krall set a culvert trap.  The bear would not trap but continued to visit the area regularly.  On 07/14 Krall used houndsman Jon Evert to run the bear with dogs.  The bear was treed and euthanized by Krall.  Meat was donated(cert #D309) and the hide and skull were retained by CPW at the Pueblo office (WST#76684, seal#37861).",

This happened last night early morning. Gave the RP hazing advice and let him know about hot wiring and bear mats for the chicken coop. The RP will be sending pictures and a video once received I will add to the report.

 WL 287 did a site inspection,  RP was putting up hot wire on his chicken coop. He buried all the dead chickens. WL 287  offered to set up a pepper barrel RP did not want the pepper barrel near his chicken coop. WL 287 that is the best place to put it because the chickens are the attractant so the barrel should go near the attractant to haze bear away from the attractant. RP declined to put it there and wanted it near the fence to the backyard where he thinks he got it in.  Pepper Barrel was out for three weeks and never got set off. WL 287 also dropped off four unwelcome mats the following Monday after the Bear Aware Volunteers made more. RP declined putting these near the chicken coop as well and  put them by the back fence.

No trap was set due  to having no target bear.  He already cleaned up and fixed the chicken coop so no hair or bear tracks found.  The photo he sent from a neighbors camera of two bear cubs walking through the neighbors driveway was from several weeks prior to the incident. This area has a lot of individual bears.  

RP called back on 10/16/2020 when WL 287 was out of cell coverage about a bear breaking fences. See other report entered.",

RP called to report that he thinks a bear broke into his chicken house and ate 15 of his chickens. The RP raises the chickens as a hobby and not as a business. This morning the RP got back from running errands and went to check his chickens. He saw that the door had been damaged and all 15 of his new chickens were gone. The RP said he did not hear anything and his dogs did not bark at all so he was unsure of when during the night the bear came by. I told the RP that since the bear was rewarded, it will most likely return. The RP said about 5 of his older chickens were unharmed so I told him to be sure to secure the chicken house and to be proactive in using deterrents so that the bear is not rewarded again. I told the RP if he does see the bear he needs to haze it with noise and look into how to build unwelcome mats or set up electric fencing. I offered to send him education materials and he was not interested and said he has lived with wildlife for years and did not want to set up fencing. The RP did not request a call back but WO544 was notified of the report. L. Berry

WL544 did a site inspection. This address was located directly next to an address that had issues with a bear on the 27th. WL544 observes two hummingbird feeders located at the residence. WL544 told the RP that he should take the hummingbird feeders down day and night because the bears are attracted to them. WL544 advised the RP that he should put up an electric fence or unwelcome mat to prevent further damage. RP acknowledges that a unwelcome mat might work. WL544 gave RP information on how to build a electric fence enclosure. RP said that he was going to put up a trail camera. WL544 said that if he was able to pattern and identify a specific bear we can try more aggressive forms of hazing but this would only occurred after he cleaned up his humming bird feeders.

They said they were going to move the hive to Penrose for a few weeks and then bring it back.

RP also told me the  bear was getting into trash they keep in a dog kennel next to their house.

Went to the RP's residence  and they showed me the dog kennel.  The dog kennel was  a section of chain link fence  attached to their house on one side.  The kennel did not have a top and was about 4 1/2 feet in height. 

Recommended they invest in a dumpster with a bear bar, told them to not leave their trash in the kennel and that they have the dumpster placed away from their residence rather than next to it.  I gave her Lone Wolf's contact information.  The RP told me she would get a dumpster with a bear bar.

Also gave her bear aware information, pyrotechnics and rubber buckshot.",

On 9/5/20 DWM Goncalves received a call from dispatch about a party, Peterson, who wanted to report that he had shot a bear in his camp.  When DWM Goncalves went to investigate, he gathered the following info:

Peterson came back to his camp on 9/4 around lunchtime and found a show and a cub eating food in their camp. Scared the bears off.

Peterson attempted to clean up most of the food but left a substantial amount that they forgot about.

Came back the next day around lunchtime again and again found the bears in camp. Scared the bears off again.

Tracked the bears about 150 yards from his camp where the sow and cub were up a tree. Shot the sow one time with his 10mm pistol. Left the scene when she came down the tree a little ways.

Went to a neighboring camp to say he had shot a bear if the person in camp wanted to cut it up. Then told them he was going to go call it in. The person in the neighboring camp declined to go get the bear.

Peterson turned himself in.

Peterson told DWM Goncalves he was worried the bears would return that night.

Peterson told DWM Goncalves he was not in fear for his life when the bear was in the tree

Peterson went back to the tree the bear was in and could not find her then looked for an hour and a half and could not find her. Cub was not present either.

DWM Goncalves found one small spot of blood.

Based on the above information DWM cited peterson for hunting without a proper and valid license.",

Wenum advised he would respond to the  scene and arrived at approx. 8:10 AM.  Zummach and wife described how they heard what sounded like a lion or bear behind their house and across a small pond that is in their backyard.  About 5:30 they heard bleating/screaming of something and suspected it was a fawn they have been seeing recently in the neighborhood.  After about 15-30 seconds of the sounds they could also hear heavy breathing and the breaking of branches/brush.  They could not see either the deer or lion/bear.  They did see a doe deer in their backyard looking (""anxiously"") toward the sounds.  Wenum and Zummach went around to the opposite side of the pond and were able to located and observe some bent over vegetation in areas (some smaller animal paths and some larger foot print areas without discernible tracks) and the small intestines of what appeared to be a fawn deer.  While doing so Wenum observed a doe deer standing nearby watching his actions.   Further checks of the area did not reveal and specific tracks or other deer parts.  Given the time of year and several nearby, recent bear incidents Wenum felt this was likely bear predation.  Zummachs have seen bears in the area in the past and it is very suitable habitat for bears  and  lions but more so in the winter for lions.

No safety issues and no further action at this point.",

SO deputies arrived when RP was speaking with Nicholson. SO deputies cleared property, scared bear off. Nicholson told RP to close and lock sliding door. Nicholson advised he would respond in morning to inspect and and set pepper barrel.

Nicholson responded and met RP. RP is older woman using walker (limited mobility). Property is trashy, but RP likely does not have means to take care of. Nicholson set a pepper barrel by back deck as deferent. Entered by Nicholson on 9/30/2020.

WL544 responded to the address where the feeding was occurring. WL544 asked Fitzgerald if he was feeding bears. He denied that he was doing any kind of feeding. WL544 asked if he had bears that came through and Fitzgerald said that he did often have bears come through the area and get into his bird feeders. WL544 asked him to take his bird feeders down to avoid conflict. Fitzgerald said that he would not take his feeders down. WL544 did warn Fitzgerald that if he had bears getting into his bird feeders it could be considered attracting bears which is illegal. Fitzgerald said that he was not attracting bears he was attracting birds. Fitzgerald said that if bears came through then that is what happens. WL544 warmed Fitzgerald that feeding bears is illegal. Fitzgerald continued to say that he was not feeding bears. Fitzgerald did let WL544 walk the property. WL544 asked what the tub of water was for. Fitzgerald said that it was for his dog. WL544 then ended the conversation and Fitzgerald did say that WL544 was welcome to come back anytime.,

on August 16th RP, Steve Curry, called CSP to report a sow and 2 cubs breaking into cars on 8/16/2020. The on-call Officer, Rocksund (542) called the RP back. Steve was worried that the 3 bears had no fear of humans and that they where out in the middle of the day. Steve told Rocksund that the neighbor had been feeding bears carrots and sugar. Rocksund asked if Steve had reported this to CPW before and he said no, it was just common knowledge that he neighborhood knew. 
Rocksund asked Steve if they have ever had issues with bears and Steve told Rocksund that last week,  Wednesday August 12th at 10AM, his wife was chased inside by the sow and the bear ran up the porch until wife slammed door.  Steve told Rocksund that his 6year old was playing outside near the driveway and had left the garage open while outside. The sow and cubs investigated the garage a few minutes after the child went inside. Steve's wife let the dog out no knowing the bears where outside and dog barked at bears. Sow chase the dog back onto the porch with the wife standing in the door. Sow slipped on the concrete and slid across porch, unable to go through door. Wife slammed the door when sow was approximately 6' away and bear went away. 
Rocksund asked Steve to report all incident of bear activity, especially when bears are being fed. Steve said he was going to report it because the bears have become no afraid of people, but saw numerous CPW trucks where the feeder lived on Friday August 14th and thought it was taken care of. It was on August 16th that Steve witness the sow and cubs going through vehicles with no fear of humans that he wanted to report the bear's activity. 
Rocksund talked to Steve on the phone and told him to remove all attractants and keep the garage door closed; even leaving it open for a few minutes could allow these bears access. Rocksund talked to a few residence and Steve about reporting all bear activity to CPW. Rocksund told them, the community, that it was on them to eliminate all attractant and haze these bears to save the bear's lives. Rocksund reinforced them that CPW does not want to kill a bear, but would be forced to if the community cannot come together and remove attractants and shut their garage doors. 
Rocksund thanked Steve and the passerby neighbors for their time and willingness to prevent future bear conflict and keeping CPW in mind when conflict does arise.

Westbrook and Doyle responded, located sow and 2 cubs and attempted to haze. See Doyle's report from 8/16/20 near Cochetopa Drive in Larkspur.",

The manager agreed that the bear had been getting into the dumpsters as well as the recycling they have behind the cafe.  The manager was instructed to contact Mt. View wast and get a dumpster with a steel led that can be secured to replace the plastic lids they currently had.  The manager agreed to do so.
WLO523 also set a pepper barrel in the back next to the recycling storage area.

On the afternoon of 13th of July the pepper barrel was removed by WLO523.  Who also noted that the Cutthroat still did not have a steel lid on their dumpster.

On the morning of the 15th of july WLO523 meet with Mt. View Wast and requested that they supply the Cutthroat with a steel lid on the dumpster.",

Laurie (and Joe) Haney at 10276 West Totem Run, Littleton contacted the office about a green ear tagged bear frequently visiting their yard.  When WL551 called them, Laurie said the bear is constantly in their yard and tearing apart their trees (Gambel's oak) and they are unable to use their yard.  She wanted it moved.  WL551 went over attractants and hazing and told her we would not be moving the bear.  WL551 discussed that Roxborough is prime bear habitat and there will always be bears there, and the importance of hazing. Laurie mentioned the neighbor had a pond and another neighbor had a hummingbird feeder, but Laurie did not have attractants in their yard.  WL551 offered to do a site visit to see if they could come up with other ideas to minimize the bear's time spent in her yard (i.e. habitat modification, etc).  

WL551 met with the Haney's at 4pm on 8/21/20, and based on what was said, this bear was not exhibiting bad behavior.  The scat is composed of fur (maybe rabbit?) and acorns.  The entire side and back of the house is loaded with oak brush and ""ripe"" acorns.  There was no sign of birdseed or any other human foods.    WL551 recommended they remove some of the oak brush close to their house to open up visibility in their yard.  Joe said they were in the process of doing so.  They also had a small water feature, which WL551 recommended removing, and Joe said he would.  WL551 again talked to them about hazing and Laurie said she can't continue to bang pots and pans (perhaps because it will annoy the neighbors).  WL551 recommended paintball and Laurie said she's not shooting a paintball gun in her yard.  She also doesn't want to throw things at the bear because she doesn't want to be that close to the bear. WL551 asked her what she is willing to do, and she said ""Call you.""  WL551 told her ""No"" and that it is her responsibility to haze animals out of her own yard.  WL551 was very clear that we would not be moving the bear since it is in excellent bear habitat and the bear is not doing anything wrong.  WL551 also explained that even if we were in a situation where we would move a bear, this one already had a strike and would need to be put down.  The contact with Laurie ended a little abruptly, since she walked away from WL551 back toward the door of the house.  Joe stayed and listened - he reiterated everything WL551 recommended.

WL551 believes this bear is #1193 which is the mother of white tag #124 (they separated in May-ish).  1193 and 124 were moved from Littleton in July 2019 due to bad location.  They returned to Waterton Canyon within three weeks.  They disappeared for the remainder of 2019 until they both showed up (and separated) this summer.   WL551 08/22/20",

Officer McKee was provided the photo of the bear in the birdfeeder at one blue cedar that was taken in September.  Apparently, several of the community members gathered around to watch this bear  at the time.  Officer Mckee went by the address on October 8 and found the birdfeeder once again hanging.  Officer Mckee contacted Jeanne.  Jeanne Stated that she was home several days ago and watched the bear hit her birdfeeder at approx 3pm.  She watched it through her window.  Once the bear was gone they refilled the feeder and rehung it.
Officer Mckee explained how this behavior was unlawful and irresponsible. Jeanne was issued a written warning.  Jeanne stated that she could not reach the birdfeeder to remove it but that she would pass all of the information along to her husband to inform him and have him remove the feeder that day.  She was told that she could not feed  birds April through November.
The second picture was taken on October 8 that shows the full birdfeeder hanging again off the tree.

WL 261 responded to the location and discovered that the bear had got into the apiary fence by climbing a wooden fence which is extremely close to the electrified fence. WL 261 recommenced moving the apiary away from the fence or removing the wooden fence completely, which the RP stated that they would be taking the wooden fence down. After being show the property by the RP WL 261 discovered that they had chicken feed, a trash bin, and a humming bird feeder around the property.

The RP stated that he had received reports of a bear getting into dispersed camps on the North side of the Arkansas river across from the Salida East Recreation Area. The RP gave a description of the camp that the bear had entered and told WL 261 that the bear had got into pots and pans with food on them that the campers had left in a bug screen near their tent. WL 261 identified this camp as the same camp that he talked to the day before about a bear getting into camp and had informed the campers to put all food, trash and anything with a scent away from their camp and in a tree if possible. The RP also informed WL 261 of a truck camper approximately 100 yards up river of the tent that had a large amount of trash outside it and suspected that the trash was drawing in the bear. He also informed WL 261 that the truck camper had broken down and AHRA was working on a way to get the truck camper removed as soon as they could. WL 261 responded to the location of the where the bear had got into pots and pans near the tent. The campers were not at camp but WL 261 did note that there was food left outside the tent under a bug net. WL 261 then noticed 5 RVs up river of the tent including the truck camper the RP had mentioned had a large amount of trash outside of it. WL 261 made contact or attempted to make contact with all the RVs and informed them that there was bear activity in the area and educated them on locking up food and trash at night in order to not attract bears. When WL 261 contacted the camp with a large amount of trash outside he contacted a male and a female individual. When informed of the bear activity in the area the Male party stated, “ok” and walked away. The female party stated that they had seen the bear and it had tore apart the engine of the truck and punctured the tire on the truck and that is why they could not leave.  She then went on to say that she worked for a secret division of the government that WL 261 probably knew about and stated that she hoped if WL 261 found sawed up human bones that she hopes he would take them to the bone collector. The female party then asked if WL 261 had an evidence bag because she really need one right now, the female party then walked away. From where WL 261 was standing at the time he could not see any evidence that a bear had broken into the truck, but do to officer safety concerns based off the conversation and behavior of the male and female parties WL 261 did not approach the truck camper any further. WL 261 then left the camps and informed WL 260 of what had taken place.

Between the times on 11:00- 11:40 PM WL 261 patrolled the North and South side of the Arkansas River on 08/21/2020. WL 261 noted that the truck camper still had an abundance of trash outside the camper and the camper door was left open.

On 08/22/2020 WL 261, WL 262, and Parks 1404 walked the camping area by the truck camper and tent and handed out ""Camping with Bears"" fliers to all camps. If campers were not in camp the fliers were left in obvious locations near their campers.",

Ben stated that he fired a shotgun in the air to frighten the bear off.  But the result was that the bear activity came in the direction of Ben rather than retreating thus Ben fired a second shot and the bear then left.
WLO523 responded to the residents and attempted to meet with Ben in person, however he was not there at that time.  WLO523 set a pepper barrel next to the coop and left a business card on the front door.  WLO523 later attempted to contact Ben over the phone as a follow up.

WL 261 called the Cutty's  Resort where the incident took place and left a message. WL 261 then responded up to the resort. WL 271 contacted the RP and the RP stated that a bear had broke a window to one of the trailers on the property. WL 261 asked if anyone was in the trailer or if the window had been left open. The RP stated that the owners were not at the trailer at the time, and that the window had been left open and that the neighbor had fed the owner's cats that night in the trailer. The RP also mentioned that last week a bear broke the door handle off the exterior of a truck which had a half eaten sandwich left in it over night. WL 261  looked at the damage to the window and informed the RP and the owner of the trailer the importance of closing windows and locking doors at night especially if there is food in either a trailer or a vehicle. The RP mentioned that the bear did not get in to the trailer just broke the lower of the window and ran off. WL 261 offered rubber buckshot but no one on the property had a shotgun that could hold the ammunition. He then gave the RP and the owner some tips on noise making devices to scare the bear off. WL 261 also requested that the RP tell this information to the rest of the resort which the RP agreed to do. The owner was also repairing the broken window that day. WL 261 told both parties to call if they had the bear come back into the resort.",

This incident at her cabin is the third time the bear has broke into a home in the past 2 weeks in that neighborhood. She said there was no food in the cabin only clothes and dishes from the previous tenant who is in the process of moving out. The bear did get into some cleaning supplies under the sink. If you cannot reach her at the number listed above her office number is 970-667-3698.

Brad is the landowner at Lonely Canyon Ranch. This morning he woke up and found his chicken coop was torn apart and all 7 of his chickens were gone. Brad drove his ATV to another location on his property where there is a car port. Brad walked up to the carport and a medium sided (200 pound) cinnamon bear ran out from the inside carport. Bears have been getting into trash and trucks on the property for the last few weeks. Officer Doyle did a site inspection and found that no efforts were done to prevent bears from accessing chickens or any potential food source on the property. Brad wanted Officer Doyle to trap and relocate the bear. Officer Doyle told Brad he had a responsibility to clean and bear-proof his property before we attempt to trap it. Brad said he has seen 4 bears on his property so Officer Doyle decided that trapping 1 bear would not solve his issue unless he took steps to bear-proof. Officer Doyle will visit the property again to insure preventative measures are being done, and will provide Brad with some rubber-buck shot for hazing.
6/5/2020 Officer Doyle visited the residence again and saw very few improvements to preventing bears. Brad was given educational documents on living with bears and how to prevent bears from getting into trash and other property. Officer Doyle gave Brad 3 rubber buck shot to haze the bear if he saw it near his home again.",

When I arrived on scene I dispersed the crowd and the bear ran west up Davis St. It was still daylight and ran within 30 yards of a populated outdoor seating area of a bar called The Barrel where patrons observed the bear running. I saw the bear minutes later in the neighborhood and hazed it away from downtown Estes with noise (clapping/yelling/running). Bear was the same seen near downtown within the past week.  No aggressive behavior observed but showed extreme comfort around large groups of people.,

WL 261 contacted that RP and the RP stated that a bear had broken in to an unoccupied camping trailer right outside her house. WL 261 responded to the location to perform a site inspection. WL 261 learned from the RP that the bear had ripped off three window screens, and cracked a window, before entering the trailer through a window that had been left open by the RP. The RP stated that once inside the bear broke a curtain cover and broke one of the draws that it had opened. The bear did get into several different types of food once in the trailer, see pictures below. WL 261 educated the RP on the importance of locking up the camper when not in use, so the scent of food does not draw bears in. He also gave the RP several different bear educational fliers and requested that if another bear incident occurs to notify CPW immediately, since on this occasion the call did not come into CPW for 2 days. WL 261 chose not to set a trap for this incident because he did not want to capture the wrong bear, and since the information was not received by WL 261 the day it happened he felt he would not be able to do this. WL 261 called and verified this with WL 260. WL 261 also got the HOA presidents information from the RP in hopes to have them send out a mass email to the entire Mesa Antero housing development that bears are active in the area and educate them on living in bear country.

On 08/25/2020 WL 261 got in contact with the HOA president and she agreed to forward an email sent to her by WL 261 with educational messaging and various bear educational fliers.",

But, it just made a circle and ended up sitting uphill of her and did not show much fear or concern of her.  

WL 290 determined the bear entered through an unlocked window by ripping a screen off and climbing in. RP's were advised to remove all trash from the property (currently locked in a connex) and to take the trash out of the camper daily to keep odors down.  The owners were also supplied with 5 round of rubber buckshot and instructed to call CPW if they used any.

WL290 set a trap on the property on the dirt pad where a future home will be built. To access the property take Old Stage Road out of Colorado Springs and turn right onto Myron Road (2.8 miles). Go through the gate (chain slides over pole) and take your first left on Felicity View and follow that road all the way to top.

Trap was pulled on 7/17/2020 by WL290 with no bear caught. RP advised to notify if bear comes back.",

Then the following night the bear returned and bit a bumper of a car parked in the same area as it searched for food as had been found the night before.
WLO523 responded to the campground and contacted the host who informed him that a number of bears had been seen in the area and that he had worked hard to see to it that campers secured their food and coolers each night before they went to bed.
The host thought there might be as many as half a dozen different bears in that general area.  The host also stated that a large group of campers had left trash alongside the road when they left and that a bear had located this trash.
The host also said that all of the ""problem"" campers had left the area and were only there during the past weekend.
A pepper barrel was set next to the camp host's RV.
WLO523 also drove around the entire campground and spoke with the remaining campers, most of whom had not seen any bears and had clean camps.

Nicholson removed pepper barrel and bear advisory sandwich board from this location to move to another campground experience bear conflicts on 8/15/2020. Camp host told Nicholson he tells people to lock up food and trash, but has difficulty getting people to comply. Camp host advised bears tore apart coolers at a campsite recently (no specific date), and a cinnamon colored bear approached within 6 feet of a woman at a site near camp host’s camp two days ago. Nicholson advised Swanson so he could follow-up. Entered by Nicholson in 8/15/2020.

Pepper barrels and signage has been moved around the campsites for the past month and a half.  A trail camera was also placed in the area and photos of moose were seen however there were not any photos of bears take  by the trail cameras.

Also, the USFS should be installing bear resistance cooler containers this following year.

On 09/10/2020 WLO523 removed the barrels and the warning signs regarding bear activity in the area.",

I spoke to the woman that was yelling and said they just got home and a black cub ran onto their deck while they were opening their front door. The woman said she had hummingbird feeders out and was going to take them in. I advised her to not put the feeders back out.

Received a call from WL281. He was contacted by one of our volunteers, Joe Kraudelt. Joe had received a call that a bear broke into a house and trashed the downstairs while the homeowner (Stacie) and her baby slept upstairs. Stacie didn't realize a bear broke in until she came down in the morning and saw everything. The house is being renovated and there is plywood covering up door and window openings. The bear tore down one of the pieces of plywood to enter the house.  Joe called Stacie multiple times while I made my way to the residence. Joe let me know that it went to voicemail every time. I arrived at the house to find nobody home. A neighbor came over and let me know that Stacie left the house and was staying with someone in the Springs. The neighbor was able to contact Stacie via cell phone. Stacie gave me permission to set the trap on the property. She also stated that she had a couple of guys that were going to stay at the house in case the bear tried to break in again. I placed the trap down below the house by the garage.  I explained to the neighbor what needs to be done if a bear is caught. I tried to call Stacie but ended up leaving a voicemail explaining the same info that I gave the neighbor.

There were small scratch marks on the side of the coop, showing 4 claws and was consistent with a smaller K-9 like a fox.  Found where it appeared a fox was going under the fence into the backyard.

DWM Gallegos was not far away so he responded immediately. The individual who had the encounter was David Bixby. He had a decent scratch on his lower back, chose not to seek medical attention. DWM Gallegos asked him to explain what happened. From his written statement:
“At approximately 4:15 this afternoon, I was connecting a hose to our outside hose bib (squatted down, low to the ground) and heard a “paw step” followed immediately by a sharp strike to my lower right back, just above the waistline. I screamed and turned to see the bear retreating and stopped about 10-12 feet away up the hill. After calling my wife and dog inside, we observed the bear lingering around the cabin for another 15-20 minutes. By that time, Andy and Melanie, our ranch managers, and other ranch residents had gathered at the bear moved off to the west, up canyon.”
DWM Gallegos learned that the ranch manager had been called, and he shot the bear with a bean bag round (given to him previously to haze bears). The bear moved away from the area.  DWM Gallegos looked for the bear, but didn’t locate it, so he set a trap. AWM Basagoitia was advised once cell coverage was available.
On the morning of 7/10, DWM Gallegos received a text from the Bixby that the bear had not come back overnight.",

Alot of trash was taken from the back of their pickup where the trash is stored uncovered. Kodiak stated the bear broke into their other pickup through the back window and ate a bag of peanuts. There was several types of birds running around including geese, chickens, and turkeys. The bear got into the feed containers for the livestock but did not bother the livestock who are roaming about freely. I informed Kodiak and also his father Jim Reigel who i spoke to on the cell phone that they need to pickup and secure their trash and any attractants or the bear would come back and do more damage if a food source is readily available. I left non-lethal bear  deterrants with Kodiak with verbal permission from the father. 

Kodiak took me to Dan Grey's residence. Dan stated that the bear got into his beer cans and some trash. I told Dan to lock up his trash and to keep his bird feeding to a minimum and in-between a specific time frame as well. Dan was left with non-lethal materials as well.",

Note-there wasn't any property damage.  The bear took dog food from the mud room.

Canterbury also told me there were several bears around and that another, much larger bear had been getting into his dumpster.  I recommended that he get a bar and place it on the dumpster to prevent the bear from getting in.

I set a trap on 07/24/20 and gave him pyrotechnics.

RP reported bear cub was on property Thursday (6/4) and her dogs spooked up a tree by house. RP reported bear cub was back near house this morning, walked around patio furniture, scratched at back door to house, and walked back near tree where observed previously before leaving. 

Nicholson responded, observed peanuts on ground near tree where cub visited. CPW captured another orphaned cub nearby and transported to rehab last week. Reports have continued about another bear cub in area without a sow. Video of that cub is consistent with this cub, and believed to be sibling of cub already taken to rehab.  

Nicholson art cage trap for cub beside tree where peanuts were on ground. RP has Nicholson’s phone numbers and will update daily of trap condition. Nicholson advised RP not to touch any animals caught in trap.

WL523 drove by the area mid morning and noted three trash cans placed along the road way near the shared driveway to 4994 and 5002.  
The RP stated that the people living at 4994 are renting the home and are new tenants from the ones that WL523 contacted the year before.  
RP also stated that Jack McCrab is the landlord and she believes that he might have a mental illness.  
WL523 made WL525 aware of the ongoing issues in this area with trash and bears as he has been addressing the issue.
It  was also noted that two of the trash cans were of a ""bear resistant"" design.  However, these cans will not prevent a bear from getting into them if they are left out, but they are still better than a totally unsecure trashcan.

RP called CSP dispatch today and requested to “retract” her complaints. RP told dispatcher she spoke with the neighbors she had been complaining about and they were doing what they could to prevent bear problems with their trash. Entered by Nicholson on 6/19/2020.",

RP advised the sow is currently up a tree and sow “hanging around” area. RP advised about 170 people in campground. 

Nicholson advised to clear that area of campground and keep people away so the cub can come down tree. Nicholson advised cub will stay up there if people don’t stay away. RP said they would clear that area of campground. Nicholson provided his cell number to RP.  RP advised they had seen bear activity since June with bears attempting to get in dumpsters. RP called back at 7:10am and advised they cleared area of campground and the cub came down and left without incident. 

Nicholson responded to campground and met with RP’s. They advised bears have visited the lower dumpster and upper dumpster in campground. They advised they tell everyone who registers in campground to keep food and trash locked up, but some people are resistant to doing so and say they have never been told to before. They advised their supervisor never told them what to do if bears came in campground, and they had never been provided with any notification procedure to request assistance from CPW. 

Nicholson set pepper barrel by lower dumpster and posted bear activity sandwich board on entry to campground near fee station. Nicholson gave CPW notice to remove attractants to RP’s and advised they can show notice to any visitors and advise the campground has a legal mandate from CPW to lock up trash and food because of bear activity. Nicholson advised they should kick anyone out of campground who fails to comply. Nicholson recommended they get paintball gun to haze any bears that enter the campground area: Nicholson provided his business card with CSP and CPW office phone numbers to contact if they have additional bear problems or questions. Entered by Nicholson in 8/15/2020

WO Sturdevant called Scott Trudeau and asked if they produced any raw agricultural products with the pond. Trudeau said no, that it was just a gold fish pond. WO Sturdevant explained that CPW does not cover personal property and that he could still fill out a game damage claim. WO Sturdevant told Trudeau that since it wasn't something that was covered under CPW laws and regulations that it would be denied in the end. Trudeau became upset, said some things and hung up on WO Sturdevant. 
WO Sturdevant went to the property and gave the game damage paperwork to Trudeau and looked at the damage.

Officer Kay was at a training and could not respond but advised Don over the phone. Don was on scene when yearling bear entered crepe shop in river run while it was still very light out. Don opened the window the bear had entered through to allow easier exit. Bear eventually came out, but did not appear worried, and was not afraid of people in the area. Despite yelling, bear did not leave area. SO showed up and tried to haze bear with human presence and yelling, but did not leave area. Officer Kay advised SO to use taser or bean bag. SO bean bagged the bear, and it eventually left, but not for about 1.5 hrs. Don from Keystone said this bear had been breaking into and eating out of dumpsters and other food sources consistently over the last few weeks and was recognizable by its size, color and apparent hump in its back. Officer Kay had heard other reports of a bear consistently hitting dumpsters in the area that matched the description. Upon inspection of the crepe shop, it did not appear that any damage was done to the windows or building, indicating the window was either open, or unlocked and easily openable. Officer Kay spoke to owner of crepe shop, Lucas Krill, and warned him about leaving windows open, and that if did not secure his restaurant, would be issued a citation next incident. Krill insisted the windows were shut and locked, and was not sure how bear got in.  Krill said the bear got into nutella, honey and brown sugar. Krill also said he had over 50 lbs of rotten bananas inside the shop that he had forgotten about.The next day, Don reported to Officer Kay that the same bear had been spotted eating out of a dumpster at Sunrise Employee Housing, at approximately 1130 hrs. Officer Kay set a trap that evening near the keystone conference center.  Trap was set for three nights, but no bear activity in keystone area during that time. Trap was taken down on 6/6. Yearling bear was potentially spotted near Keystone Gulch on 6/8",

He told dispatch the bear was not around and the mobile home trailer may have some damage to it. Hewitt called back and told dispatch she was going to jump out of her window and make a run for it. 
     Wildlife Officer Martinez visits Hewitt along with a different Sherriffs Deputy later that night after she called dispatch the second time. Upon making contact, there was no bear visible or no sign of bear prints were observed around the residence. The lady was somewhat cooperative in removing the three dogbowls she had on the porch in front of the main entrance to the residence. She was told that a bear would be attracted to the food she puts out for the dogs and was told to feed the dogs in the day and put the bowls away at night. She seemed to be confused in different aspects of her story and kept showing her dogprints and saying they were bear prints.",

On the morning of 07/18/2020 the bear returned at approximately 9:40 AM and got into marshmallows and Gatorade left out by campers. Wildlife 266 responded and educated the campers in the area again about the importance of locking away food when not in use. Wildlife 266 again hazed the bear using noise making pyrotechnics.  The RP believed at this time that there were two different bears in the camp, distinguishable because one had a white patch on its chest. RP believed bears to be approximately 200 lbs.

No damage was done to the tent. Wildlife 261 responded and set a trap in the best available location in the campground and walked to each individual site in the camp ground and instructed campers that attractants had to be put away and locked up when not in use, and made them aware that a trap was being set. The trap was set at 6:20 PM and the RP was informed on how to use it.

I, WL367 called the Christopher (landowner/RP) and left voicemail. I visited the property the next day and met with Debra Schultz (602-513-1463), who takes care of the house. Debra showed me around the house inside and out. There was several areas of forced entry by a bear. This house has not had occupants inside as it is used for seasonal use. The eastern window and the northern upstairs door were both entry points. Another door on the west side had a broken screen. The bear was all over the residence both downstairs and up. The kitchen was the main attractant for the bear as it opened and destroyed all types of food sources.

She loves the bear and does not want it to be killed. She showed me a video she took of the bear coming out of her truck from about 15 feet away, the bear did not seem to care that she was there. Looks like the same bear from 40420 and Marine street issues. Lisa did not want to send me the pictures but said she would call if another incident happened. We talked about home security, trash security and removing attractants. She also admitted that she had put out food for the raccoons that the bear had eaten, but she would stop doing that. I told her that if she is able to report issues quickly we can respond by hazing and bear activity won't escalate to the point of needing relocation or euthanasia.",

While waiting there Officer Kay saw the bear begin to head back to Salt Lick neighborhood. Officer Kay followed the bear and began to approach and yell at it once it got close to houses. Bear was overall not scared or intimidated by human presence, and would run off only 20-30 yards when approached at close range. Officer Kay eventually got a clear shot and shot one round of rubber buck. Bear ran about 30 yards and stopped. It became dark and the bear was last seen nestled in a gully near the neighborhood.",

When BA  arrived WPPD Officer Mike had already cleared the house and the bear(s) were gone.  The bears were reported to have moved SW along the green belt.  The sow and cubs appear to move off when hazed but stroll through the neighborhood when not confronted.

A construction dumpster in front of the house has non-construction trash in it and about half full is the attractant.  Per Terri Collins the bears have been frequenting the dumpster attracting a crowd wanting to see the bears and take pictures.  

We spoke to several residents in the area.  They confirmed the bears are frequenting the dumpster regularly. 

Terry Collins said she was going to contact the general contractor so they can request that they don't throw non-construction trash into it.  I asked the neighbor across the street, at 1314, to call if the bears showed up again.  

Drove around the subdivision and spoke to anyone with garage doors open.  Also drove around the Northwood subdivision.


Recommendation:
Speak to the construction crew about having the dumpster dumped as it is an attractant.
Canvass the subdivision to education about being bear aware",

WL 261 then contacted the RP. The RP stated that a sow with a single cub had been seen around his house earlier that week. He then stated that earlier the day of the incident he had installed the dog door into the swing door of his garage. He had left the door propped open that night. At around 10:30 PM the sow and cub entered the garage through the open door and got to the open dog food which was in the garage. At some point the door closed behind the bears and they could not leave the way they came in.  After some time of running through the garage the sow and cub finally exited the garage through the dog door which was destroyed in the process. The RP also had noticed that something had got into his dog food in the garage a few weeks prior while the door was opened but thought it was just a stray dog in the area.  WL 261 contacted WL 266 who was closer to the address to respond and perform a site inspection. WL 266 gave the RP a couple unwelcome mats to put near the dog door and issued him some rubber slugs to help haze the bears if they are seen again.",

She told me that he told her it had a limp and it may be injured.  She told me the bear was in his yard at that time.

I went to Muth's residence and  the bear was not there.  Muth did not have any bear attractants.  His property is adjacent to BLM land with excellent bear habitat.

We hiked around his property and we didn't see the bear.  As I was leaving he ran out of his house and told me the bear was back.  We then observed the bear in his backyard.  The bear had a limp and possibly an injured front left leg.  I did not think the injury warranted the bear being euthanized.  The bear ""spooked"" and sprinted away.  

I gave Muth rubber buckshot and asked him to shoot the bear if it came into his yard again.  I asked him to not shoot it if it was out on the BLM land where it belonged.

Bear was an average sized brown colored black bear.  It did not have eartags.

While talking to Muth he told me he had seen three other bears, but since this other, larger bear showed up he hasn't seen the other bears.

Asked Muth to call me if he needed more rubber buckshot.  When the fire ban is lifted I will give him M-80s.",

Bear kept coming back consistently. RP tried hazing and taking in all his trash. RP had an alarm set on a motion detector to try and scare the bear away. At around 2am the RP’s dog was barking so he let him out. The RP’s dog then started barking and eventually scared off the bear for a moment. The bear did come back even while RP was standing outside with his dog. RP felt the bear was being aggressive approaching him and his dog. RP stated he was scared the bear was going to break into his house next. When the RP came out the next morning he noticed the bear had broken into his garage where he kept his trash. RP also noticed that the bear had broken into their vehicles and eaten some sunflower seeds. WL 544 came out and did a site inspection. WL544 did notice a bird feeder but the RP said the bear had never gotten into the bird feeder. WL544 advised that he should take it in until after thanksgiving. WL544 decided to set a trap since the bear was rewarded with food in the RP’s garage. RP believes bear is being attracted due to neighbors trash.

I went to the neighbor's residence and spoke to him about the bear.  He showed me a video of the bear rolling around an aluminum trash can that was outside on his porch.  

The man told me he shot into the ground a couple of times to scare the bear away.

Advised him to bring his hummingbird and chipmunk feeders inside.  Gave him 'bear aware' materials.  Told him to call me if the situation changes.

Went to the neighbors in the area and left 'bear aware' literature.",

WL 261 was close by and met the RP at the location. The RP stated that he just sat down under a tree to have lunch and a nap when he saw a sow and 2 cubs. He stated that the sow walked towards him but did not display any aggressive behavior or make any grunts or popping noises. He stated that he then threw his lunch towards the bear and ran out of the area as fast as he could. WL 261 informed the RP that the sow and cubs were probably along the river to escape the heat of the day and would probably be moving out of the area sometime shortly after sunset. WL 261 went down to the are where the RP saw the bear but it was on a piece of heavily wooded private property that WL 261 could not find permission to enter. Due to its location to a city owned trail WL 261 put bear activity in the area signs up at the the nearest trail head.,

Multiple calls to both CSP Dispatch and the CPW Grand Junction Office came in through the day with sightings around the Bookcliff Golf Course area.  At approximately 1730 I received a call from CSP Dispatch that the sub-adult Black Bear was in the back yard at 754 27 RD Grand Junction.  Wildlife Officers 442, 447, and 441 attempted to tree the bear at that location, and than in the a joining Golf Course to no avail.  The bear would not tree and continued to run eventually crossing 27 Rd. to the West and was last seen at 755 Continental Ct.  The decision was made at that time to let the bear calm down and attempt to trap it if it was sighted again. The bear was reported to  the CPW  Office as being photographed by a door cam early on the 08/18/20 at 753 Centauri Dr.

WL 186 responded immediately to the call.  Upon arrival Officer Foster contacted Emily Hill. She stated the bear got into her house through a open door she had just opened for her dog to go out and use the restroom. The bear entered the house and went through the kitchen and broke window latches and plant pots trying to get out of the house. Luckily the door was still open and it exited the same door it came in through. The whole time the bear was in the house her kids were locked in their bedroom and she was upstairs.

WL 186 Set a trap and informed her to call him if the bear returns.

WL 283 talked with the second RP. She stated that she was tying her child’s shoe. Another kid told her that a bear was behind her. The RP turned around seeing a bear walking towards her.  She turned around and got her kid up on a bridge and turned around to see the bear walking away with her backpack. The backpack was sitting about 2-3 feet behind her. She stated that the bear did not growl or make any aggressive movements to her.  The bear then walked about 30 yards away and went through the backpack. Once the bear finished with the backpack, it came walking back up the creek and hung around in the water and scratched itself on some trees. The Nature Center then drove by in their Jeep on the trail and the bear ran away.

WL283 walked about a half mile along the creek to try and find the bear, but did not find it. WL 283 informed the Nature Center that they needed to put signs up to warn hikers, and talked to the center about what they can do to haze and report about the bear. 

WL 283 then went with the RP back to the scene to get her backpack. WL 283 collected a hair from the bear.",

On October 21 Ken Caryl Ranger’s were patrolling near the Manor House trails and Observed trash scattered.  The garbage all lead to the dumpster at the Manor House and trash was observed all around the dumpster.  
McKee visited the Manor House on the 22nd but nobody was present.  A photo was taken of the dumpsters and the damaged lid on one of them.  McKee later spoke with CR Brinton, the Manor House Manager.  He stated they have problems with bears getting in their dumpsters every fall.  There is one in particular that visits every year.  It has been able to breech  the plastic lid on the dumpsters on several occasions.  The bear has been hitting them regularly now for the last three weeks.  The other day they had a close call when one of their staff members went to place a bag in the dumpster and the bear jumped out of it.  The employee was not injured.  McKee told them that the plastic lids were not adequate and that they needed to remedy the situation immediately.  CR stated that he is not in charge of the trash but that he did talk to his employee that is and that metal lids have been ordered and they are hoping to be in and installed within the next couple weeks.  
In order to document the contact, the Manor House was issued a written warning for trash and CR accepted the warning on behalf of the Manor House.  
They were provided bear literature with additional ideas to secure their trash.  They were also provided bear  dumpster stickers to remind employees to lock them up at night .

RP called to report that he shot a problem bear twice with rubber buck shot last night. Around 10:30pm the RP's wife chased a bear out of their hog pen but it returned a few minutes later. The RP shot it with the buck shot once and it returned again about a half hour later. The RP again shot it with rubber buck and when the RP woke up this morning there was damage to the hog feeder from the bear again. The RP said that he had problems with bears in the past and wildlife officers had placed a trap on his property last year. I recommended using bear unwelcome mats but he is worried about his other livestock stepping on the mats. I also recommended using scent deterrents. The RP requested a call back from the district officer as he is getting frustrated because he is constantly having to repair the hog feeder. WO 544 was contacted and made aware of the request for a call back. LB

WL544 did a site inspection. WL544 observed the hog pin. WL544 saw that the food was in a trough in the pig enclosure. WL544 told the RP that rubber buckshot and other hazing methods would not be effective and that he should put up an electric fence if he wants to keep the bear out. WL544 gave the RP some more rubber buckshot for the time being. WL544 did stress that this would not solve his problem and he needed to either clean up the trough or install his electric fence.",

RP called to report a very large black bear that has been seen in the neighborhood and the RP's property every night. Around 2am, the RP and his wife heard a bear rolling their bear proof cans around before breaking into them. The RP thinks that the bear is at least 350lbs and has broken open both the RP's and a neighbor's bear proof trash cans. The RP has hazed the bear every night for the past week by going outside and yelling at the bear. The RP says that in the past, smaller bears have run away quickly but this bear stands it's ground and last night, the bear began approaching the RP. The RP has tried covering his trash can in bleach and removed all other attractants on his property but the bear returns and is rewarded with the trash from the broken trash cans. The RP says that the bear is rewarded all over the neighborhood by neighbors with both bear proof cans and unsecured trash cans. The RP is worried that the bear is getting more aggressive and bold. I told the RP to consider speaking to neighbors about securing their trash within secure buildings to prevent the bear from being rewarded. I told the RP to try placing rags soaked in ammonia on the trash cans if he cannot place the cans within a building like a garage. I also told the RP to keep bear pepper spray handy and to try placing bear unwelcome mats around the property also. I told the RP that he can set off his car alarms and use airhorns out a window so he does not go outside because of the bear's bold nature. RP requested a call from an officer. WLO525 was made aware and given the RP's contact information. L.Berry

Officer Nicholson responded to property, RP not home. Nicholson observed bear resistant trash cans outside and a can that appears to hold food waste beside grill and below kitchen window. Nicholson called and left message for RP, suggesting paintball gun to haze, clean cans with bleach, and store all food waste inside home. Officer Nicholson left his cell number.

She stated that  the bear seemed confused and was walking around their property.  It was trash day, but the trash had already come. The bear did not seem afraid of their large dog that was going crazy over the bear. The RP went outside and yelled at the bear. It did not seem afraid of them either. They fired a shot into the ground since the they were out of rubber rounds. The bear ran off.

Bear aware report: 
Contacted RP after request from WL281. She wanted rubber buck but has 20 ga. She did find some on line.  She has not had problems with bear other than it travels thru her property and she has to pick up neighbors trash. Advised her to call me if trash problem persists. Went to 81 Aspen Ln. next and realized John and I had been there last year.( RP- female was very uncooperative and husband had to come out and calm her down, and talk to us.) Same female answered the door and I introduced myself and asked her name, she did not tell me but said ‘I remember you’. I asked if they were still having bear problems and she said yes. I asked if they needed more rubber buck and she said yes and took it from my hand. I told her that I remembered talking to them about keeping their trash in the garage and that it was still outside. She said she keeps it out all day and brings it in at night because she doesn’t want her classic cars to stink. I tried to tell her about bleaching can and freezing meat scraps but she cut me off and said” I’m going to keep doing just what I have been, leaving trash out during day with a nail board, and bring ing it in at night.” They had a nail board with some spikes in it near the can. She then walked back into the home.

TWO PROBLEMS to address: There is a large brown female bear that has been a problem in this neighborhood for years. I have been on numerous calls here the last few years.

Second the folks at 81 Aspen Lane are part of the problem and have been advised to keep garbage secured twice. She is hostile and may require further LE action. ( tried to get names on county site but it was not working)

I also visited folks at 35 Aspen Ln. who have seen the bear and watched it get into their trash can last Thursday after they had put it out for pick-up. Did education and issued rubber buck and told to call if further problems.",

A veterinarian was on scene providing care to the 2 goats that were injured. The goats are secured in the barn every night around 8:30PM. It appears the bear was able to climb up and over a wall. RP was advised to secure the barn wall all the way to ceiling and RP said they would do that today.

WL 290 set a trap by the barn and shed. The target bear will likely be a large dark brown or black colored boar, based on the pile of scat and hair found. RP was left with game damage claim paperwork.

WL 287: Bear with white ear tag trapped and euthanized.  RP said there were two bears around her barn in the AM. Another trap was set for the other bear.

He lives in the edge of city limits and has a safe backstop to haze a bear.

From Volunteers: 
Call from RP at 11:55 of a cub up a tree that kept going up higher in the tree and crows harassing it.  Arrived at 12:10.  Adult was bear up a tree in the back yard outside the fenced-in area approx 30 feet high.  Bear didn't appear to be injured but awake and alert.  No distress sounds from the bear as I approached the tree for a better look.  RP said their dog alerted them to the bear's presence by barking.  Bear Aware education to the RP and family and a quick site assessment.  Advised about garage doors, ground-level windows, bird feeders (one in the backyard), and locking automobiles.  Canvassed the area.
RP had my card from last week's canvassing hence why she called me directly.",

RP stated that last night he was returning from walking his dog and was alerted by his name that a bear was in his yard and to be careful.  He put his dog in the house and grabbed his bear spray.  Started yelling at the bear, sprayed it in the face and it went across to the street to a common area with a pond and went up a tree.  Before he used the bear spray the bear did a bluff charge.  His concern is when he was yelling the bear wasn't in any hurry to get away as it was going thru his neighbors trash.  The common area is next to a day care and that concerned him too.  He asked when we relocate bears.  I suggested that if his neighborhood would adopt a bear proof trash container policy that would mean it wouldn't get rewarded and hence eventually not return.  Also mentioned that bird feeders were big bear attractants and would need them taken down .  He is going to post some info on Next door from the emailed bear packet I sent him.  T.Wallace NERO
Officer Olson contacted the RP to further discuss the aggressive behavior and he detailed the incident basically as described above but added he feels confident the Bear was sprayed with pepper spray and showed effects from it. The bear maintained a distance of around 15-20 yards the entire time even when bluff charging and vocalizing and popping jaws during the instance. It sounds like the neighborhood has been having visits from a bear the past three nights or so. Officer Olson further discussed removing attractants and drove through the area. Also coordinated a NextDoor posting to the neighborhood regarding bear aware practices and removing attractants. J Olson #088",

RP called to report a bear that came last night the bear was standing out in the yard next to the truck as RP was working in the garage. Bear did teeth chattering and the bear did a fake bluff charge. RP's boyfriend yelled and the bear ran around the side of the house. They did not see the bear after this. Black color, tan-ish brown nose. 
The same bear, they believe, ripped off the garage door three weeks ago. Next night after they replaced it, the bear was standing on the other side of the leach field. Bear came back two nights later and lifted up the NEW garage door and was pulling trash out of the garage. 
Trash is already locked in garage. No bird feeders on property. I told RP to use bear unwelcome at the garage doors and outside the front of the garage. RP knew how to build one. I told RP to continue to yell at it and bang pots and pans, air horns and bear pepper spray if the bear comes within 30 ft. I also told RP to invest in a painball gun and freeze the paintballs. If the bear returns to shoot the bear with the frozen paintball guns. RP acknowledged receiveing a bear packet by email. -M. Gallegos",

WL 288 and 287 went to the address to investigate. The sow is the injured sow with  two cubs that has been seen in the area throughout summer. WL 287 believes there in not an abandoned cub, as  a cub was found shot  in a near by neighborhood on 09/24/2020. This cub was distinct due to an ear missing.  The RP had multiple videos of the family playing in her pond. Videos show the sow with two cubs, one having a missing ear. 

 Both the sow and the cub were facing uphill and had blood coming from their noses.  They had most likely died sometime the previous day.  WL 287 and 288 looked for trauma and could not find any.  The metal detector was unable to locate  metal. 

The RP had mouse bait in 4 mouse trap containers, \.  The bears did not get into these. 

Both bears are being sent to the health lab.",

He said it got into a cooler with water in it and into the bed of a truck.  A neighboring landowner had also seen the bear around their residence with no incident.  Another dispersed camper in the area had also had the bear around his camper.  On the evening of June 16 Krall enlisted the help of houndsmen Jon Evert to try and haze the bear with hounds.    Stayed out until 2200 hours but were unsuccessful in finding the bear.  On June 17 at about 0600 Evert was successfull in running the bear with hounds starting at the dumpster in Lake Creek Campground.  The bear was treed several miles east in Lake Creek on Trails End Ranch.  Krall gained permission from the landowner and used non lethal bean bag rounds on the bear.  As of 06/19 have not had any more reports of the bear.,

RP called to report a bear that has been seen on her property many times in the past 3 weeks. Each time, the RP and her husband have used pots and pans to create noise to deter the bear. There are no attractants on the property and bird feeders are only outside in the winter. The latest sighting of the bear was last night while the RP and her husband were eating dinner. They heard a noise and looked at their front door and saw the bear through the glass. The RP said it looked like the bear was scratching the door to get in. She and her husband again yelled again to scare the bear away. Each time they have seen the bear it has had the same cinnamon coloring which makes the RP think it is the same bear each time. She is worried that it is becoming less scared of them every time they chase it away.  I recommended the use of bear unwelcome mats and ammonia soaked rags around the property. I offered education materials but she declined them so we went over other hazing techniques and she and her husband have bear spray to use as defense if the bear gets too close. 
RP Called back around 2:15pm to say the bear had returned while she and her husband were outside building unwelcome mats for their doors. The RP's husband had bear spray and sprayed the bear. The RP said it was super windy so the bear may not have been hit with much spray but it was sprayed. The bear ran up a tree and stayed there for about 15 minutes then climbed down and ran off. LB

Nicholson met with RP, inspected home, found no attractants out. RP walked Nicholson through each encounter. Unknown if same bear that entered home in nearby neighborhood, some behavior consistent. Nicholson offered to set pepper barrel, and RP accepted. Nicholson set pepper barrel near back of garage and back deck where bear conflicts have occurred.

Entered by Nicholson on 6/17/2020.

Nicholson removed pepper barrel on 6/28/2020. RP advised something got bait bag on pepper barrel and they have not observed bear since. RP thanked Nicholson for the help. Entered by Nicholson on 6/28/2020.",

""Sharon"" contacted Jason Clay via social media regarding a facebook post by John Paul Hargan stating a bear had just attempted to go through his screen door to gain access to his kitchen. Jason Clay made WL521 aware. No contact information was in the post. A possible location described as the third switchback on Quartzville Road was listed in a different post. 

WL521 took a trap to the area and began looking for the correct residence. After speaking with several residents in the area, it was determined that the incident had likely occurred at 1223 Quartzville Rd. Officer Petkash contacted John Hargan at the bottom of the driveway as he was leaving. J. Hagran was aggravated that the wildlife officer was present. The officer requested to put a trap on the property and J. Hagran stated the officer would have to talk to his brother. He elaborated, ""He's gonna be mad. He's an asshole. He's also bi-polar"" WL521 asked J. Hagran to help talk to his brother Patrick Hagran. J. Hagran called P. Hagran on the phone from the driveway. WL521 could hear P. Hagran yelling into the phone from the house up the hill. 

WL521 asked J. Hagran to go to the house with him to speak with P. Hagran. J. Hagran agreed and spoke to his brother through the front door. P. Hagran was yelling at J. Hagran about CPW being notified. WL521 asked P. Hagran to come out on his porch so they could speak. A few minutes later, P. Hagran had begun to calm down. P. Hagran initially refused to allow WL521 to set a trap. P. Hagran stated that he normally fires shots in the air from a firearm to scare the bears away. He stated one time he shot a concrete retaining wall and the concrete fragments scared that bear away. P. Hagran stated his property had been visited by 3 bears; one with 2 ear tags, one with 1 ear tag and one with no ear tags. Eventually P. Hagran gave permission for the trap to be set. WL521 set the trap at the base of the driveway. 

Note: P. Hagran had numerous sores covering both forearms indicative of methamphetamine use. Approximately a dozen Rx pill bottles were observed on a coffee table in the living room while WL521 was standing at the front door.

Around noon on the 28th of July WLO 523 received information that a bear had been caught in the cage trap set by WLO 521.  WLO 523 contacted WLOs 520, 521, and 522 to decide if this was the target bear and what should be done with this bear.  WLO 523 tagged this bear with green ear tags number 733 and released the bear up Michigan Creek Road.  The bear was also hit with yellow paint balls when released.  Bear has pit tag of number 985121006908449 under the skin in the top of the head between the ears.",

The cub ended up going up a pine tree at 518 Wilcox st. WLO549 responded to the location and did crowd control. When it got dark 549 went to her truck and watched the tree for the cub to come down. At 7:40pm the cub came down the tree and wandered a few blocks. WLO549 monitored the bear until it was UTL. No other calls about the cub came in after 8:30PM. - WLO549",

RP stated unwelcome mats lined the coup except at the gate. WL521 was aware that he, WL525 and WL524 have advised him that electric fencing is necessary on his property. RP stated he hasn't built electric fencing because of the cost. RP was extremely agitated during the conversation. 

RP stated the bear also tore the doors off his barn and ate livestock grain. RP stated the bear also tried to pull a screen off a window under his deck and killed a cat. RP stated that he will shoot the next bear that goes into his coup. WL521 asked the RP if he had any questions about the legal requirements for killing a bear after their last conversation. RP stated he remembered the law. 

WL521 advised WL525 who will decide how to proceed. Entered by Petkash.

Nicholson responded to  RP’s address. Nicholson found door on chicken pen bent open and feathers and chicken parts. RP arrived and showed door to his shed. Door was not tore off. Recent paint was on door and no scratches were present as would have been expected. RP showed Nicholson a broken hinge and said bear broke it. Nicholson is skeptical a bear broke hinge and suspects RP broke hinge on purpose to attempt to get justification for a trap set. RP showed Nicholson a trash bag tipped over and tore open in shed. RP said bears got trash bag and a peanut butter jar,  but did NOT touch any livestock feed/grain. RP said his cat was missing, unknown if was killed by a bear or not. RP did not see bears, but said he believed it was sow with 3 cubs that were at neighbors. 

RP is not a truthful person. He lied about cat being killed by bears, bears tearing door off shed, and bears eating livestock grain. Evidence that bears killed chickens was evident though. Nicholson set a pepper barrel between goat pen and remaining chicken pen with chickens and a turkey. Nicholson advised he was not setting a trap and RP needed to figure out a way to get electric fence, or at least a single hot wire ran around pens. Entered by Nicholson on 8/8/2020.

On 8/28/2020 WL 522 picked up the pepper barrel. Mr Burkit said the bear and 3 cubs was there the night before and broke into the chicken coop that had dead chickens in it still. Burkit said he was going to get electric fencing soon but wanted to say that the government should buy the fencing for him. Entered by Tyler Stoltzfus.

On 8/29/2020 Mr. Burkit called me vary upset about the bear coming back to his house. He said if we don't do something about the bear then he will and we will have four dead bear. Mr. Burkit shouted and cussed over phone for several minutes. He said that he has lost over 60 animals now to bears and that he cannot afford electric fence materials. He said if we don't give him the electric fence he will kill the bears. Entered by Tyler Stoltzfus

Officer Nicholson has conducted background records investigation of this subject, and verified he is restricted from possessing a firearm or other weapon. Any officer who responds to this address should request criminal record query and take appropriate action if Burkitt is found to possess or use weapons. Burkitt has previously told Officer Nicholson he is aware of his restrictions on weapon possession. Entered by Nicholson on 8/30/2020.",

RP interested in filing a game damage claim, and would like to talk to a game warden. Wl329 visited with landowner. Landowner told officer that this was a small calf from a 1st time mother cow. The cow wasn’t overly protective of the calf and it was much smaller than the other calves. Landowner stated that coyotes and bears were in the area. Officer skinned the calf.  No puncture wounds on head, neck or throat. There was blood from the mouth of the calf. One of the ears had ragged edges that looked like it had been chewed upon.  Hind end and some viscera of calf was eaten. Small scratches on hide that did not penetrate through the hide,  were found. A small puncture mark was  found on the hide of the hind quarter where the muscle tissue had been eaten. The carcass was moved about 10 feet, as seen by a drag mark. Vultures had been on the carcass. WL 329 determined that a bear or lion did not kill the calf.  Due to puncture size, location and missing parts from hind end, coyote was determined to be culprit . Lack of puncture wounds around head/neck broken neck, crushed trachea and deep larger (more damaging )scratches ruled out bear and lion.",

RP called WL551 directly since she had contact info from the previous year where bears were eating grapes from the grape vines that cover a large portion of the house.  Rubber buck was issued last year which the RP still had not deployed.  This year the RP claimed they were being held ""hostage"" in their house.  RP wanted the bear moved.  After doing a site visit on July 18, 2020, it was determined the bear was coming around approximately once a month, although this was the first call WL551 received this year from the RP.  The sightings were as follows:
April 21, 2020 - Bear broke into outbuilding where cat sleeps and litter is stored. 
May 19, 2020 - Saw on home video bear walking around cars in driveway and around shed.
May 23, 2020 - Kay went on porch and bear was on porch.  Kay yelled and bear ran off, then stopped and looked back.  Bear left the area without aggression,
June 30, 2020 - Bear was on porch, near car, and knocked empty trash can over.
July 12, 2020 - Bear was on porch.
As a note, this property is covered with plum trees, chokecherry, oak brush, as well as the grape vines covering the front of the house.  WL551 explained to the RP that sightings will always occur in this area as a result of the excellent bear habitat.  WL551 explained that sightings in bear country are expected, however, they need to haze the bear to make it uncomfortable around humans and uncomfortable in our immediate space, such as the porch.  WL551 discussed the removal of attractants, including the grapevines.  Kay said she will not be removing the grapevines as it took them many years to grow them. 

Aside from the many natural attractants (and grapevines), the property appears to be fairly clean.  WL551 discussed paintball, airhorns, pots and pans, etc.  The RP's son, grandson, and two neighbors were also there for the in-person meeting.  Neighbor Michele Miller said she would help distribute Bear Aware info to the neighborhood (WL551 emailed her 7/19/20).  The RP's son and grandson were going to look into purchasing a paintball gun.  WL551 offered to haze the bear personally if the RP could pattern the bear based on her home videos and WL551 would wait for them to provide this info.  WL551 is also going to put together a press release for Miller to post on social media for the neighborhood.

The RP heard heavy foot steps in the camp site with some huffing around 1:30 in the morning. The RP asked her boyfriend, Aaron Carpenter, if he heard the sound. The bear was heard knocking stuff off of the picnic table that was about 7-10 feet from the tent.  Then the steps got closer to the tent. The bear put its front paws on top of the tent. The tent collapsed on the RP and her boyfriend. Both struggled to get out from under the bear. All parties were startled and the bear retreated a short distance away and was huffing and popping his teeth. The RP’s boyfriend then set the panic alarm off on their vehicle and the bear was not heard from again. The RP and her boyfriend never saw the bear. The RP and her boyfriend left after that.

WL283 inspected the scene the next morning. WL283 met with the Rachel and Aaron. WL283 found that some plates were knocked off the picnic table. The plates were plastic and clean in a mesh bag. There was no food on the table or anywhere in the campsite. There was no food in the tent with Rachel and Aaron. There was a tear in the rain fly of the tent, but the bear never got in the tent and never directly contacted Rachel or Aaron directly. All contact had the tent wall between bear and humans. WL283 found bear tracks in the campsite. The tracks appeared to be made from a smaller bear. WL 283 talked with the staff from the campsite and they stated that there was a smaller brown colored bear that has been seen around the campsite for about 3 weeks. The bear has gotten into trash before at the facility.  I asked if anyone had pictures of the bear and one of the caretakers of the property sent me pictures of the bear (attached above). Rachel and Aaron never saw the bear. WL283 never found any hairs or any evidence that would contain DNA. 

Rachel stated that she had felt a scratch on her head. WL283 did not see any visual wound on Rachel’s head. Rachel stayed that it was possible that she scratched herself when she curled up to protect her head, or it could have been the tent pole, or it could have been the bear. No direct skin to bear contact was made. 

WL283 set a bear trap in the campsite 137. The bear trap will remain in the site for 3 days or until it catches a bear. The target bear would be a smaller bear, probably the brown bear. The bear will be relocated.

The trap was pulled on 5/7/2020. No bear was caught and the bear that was hanging around the campground has not been seen since the incident.",

Upon further questioning the RP stated that he went outside to see what his dogs were barking at. He saw his dogs near a bear, that was in a tree. He was scared his dogs were going to be attacked so he went to pull them back. As he got closer he felt like his life was in danger and he shot and killed the bear.

She told me they recently moved  to the residence and explained that one night it got into a freezer full of food (located outside of the house), on another night it got into the car, and the night before her husband could hear two bears in their yard.

I went to the residence and looked at the vehicle.  When I asked the RP if the window was cracked or left open she told me the windows were rolled up.  When looking at the vehicle most of the glass was outside of the vehicle which made me think the widow was probably cracked  or partly opened .

When I looked inside the car there was a large amount of trash--pop cans, ramen noodle cups etc.  When talking to the RP she told me she even had a crock pot in the vehicle.

Advised the RP to remove all the trash and deep clean the vehicle.  Also advised her to pull the car into their garage and leave it in there until the window can be repaired.  I told the RP I did not feel comfortable setting a trap because so much time has passed.

Went over basic ""bear aware"" information and told her to call if she had any other issues.

Note-The back portion of the residence has a large amount of gamble oak and is one of the few places with acorns.  I have a lot of bears in this area.",

The RP was not looking for game damage, just wanted to inform WL 261 of the incidents. WL 261 informed the RP that if he closed his garage door when he leaves the house that should resolve the bear getting into the food within it, and discussed different types of ways to electrify the chicken coop that he has in order to keep all predators out of it including both bears and coyotes. WL 261 also informed him that he is allowed to put down any bear that he sees actively predating on his heard of cows. The RP was very grateful for the advice and said that he would implement  all the advice given to him. WL 261 is also going to get the RP rubber buckshot on a future date when the RP will be at home.",

It was apparent that the bear had gotten into trash stored on the deck the night before and thus had returned twice looking for additional food rewards a paper barrels placed on the property and the homeowners were encouraged to secure their trash to avoid any further bear incidences.

The pepper barrel was removed on August 28th by WLO523.",

She wanted to remain somewhat anonymous about the issues they were having with bears in fear of losing her job. She stated that the owner Greg wanted her to call CPW and inform them that the bears are acting aggressively towards staff and guests so CPW would destroy them. She stated  that Greg also made comments about going on a bear hunt and getting rid of the evidence if CPW didn’t do anything. She stated that Greg also wasn’t willing to pay to get bear proof trash cans and a dumpster. The Guide camp at the west end of the property is also an issue with cooking and food supplies easily accessible to the bears. 527 discussed hazing techniques as well as other deterrents. 527 told the RP that he would do a site visit later in the day to talk to Greg and also set a pepper barrel.

At approximately 16:30 WL 527 arrived at the address to inspect the property.  WL 527 spoke with female staff member who stated that the bear activity was increasing and the newer staff was not as families with bears as others and that the bears have been getting into food at the guide camp. She also stated that the bears are getting more use to the people and not easily scared but also not aggressive. WL 527 then spoke with a partial owner named Alan. 527 covered hazing techniques with Alan (Paintballs, rubberbuck, bear mats) as well as using ammonia to clean the dumpster and trash cans.  Alan stated that they were working on getting bear proof trash cans and a dumpster. 527 told Alan that it was their responsibility to remove all attractants and that if they didn’t they could be sited for attracting bears. 527 told Alan that the guide camp needed to be cleaned up and that all staff as well as guest need to be told to lock their vehicles at all times. 527 told Alan that guests need to be told to lock doors on cabins and yurts and to secure their food when the arrive for their stay. 527 provided Alan with Living With Bears pamphlets and fliers to further educate staff and guests. 527 then set blue pepper barrel #2 near the dumpster.  WALTER

RP called CSP on 7/19 to say that the bear broke into a vehicle and trash again. She said that some of the  staff was talking about hunting the bear for the damage that it caused. She wanted us to know that the owners are not planing to bear proof anything that she knows of.

WL 527 pulled blue pepper barrel #2 on 8/2. Took it to Mt Evans SWA",

Myself and Scott Young of USDA Wildlife Services attempted to locate and euthanize the bear by 12:30 PM.  However, bear was not located by 2:30 PM.  Tracking conditions were difficult with 95 degree weather.  We returned at 7:00 PM, still not finding the bear.  Advised prison staff to tell us if they see any tracks or other sign of the bear.  Prison has a compost pile that likely attracted the bear, but with no indication that the bear had been in the area very long as there was no scat anywhere to be seen.

RP threw things at the bear and it did not retreat. When the RP tried to haze the bear, it came towards him. RP fired one 9mm round at the ground in front of the bear, at which point the bear walked away. RP reports a neighbor told him that someone in the neighborhood had been feeding bears.

On 10/09/2020 WL544 got a call from Douglas county at 11:45pm. Douglas County informed WL544 that residence had been calling about 7350 Fremont place because they were leaving their garage door open. Douglas county was on their way to contact the home owner about this as residence were concerned their neighbor was attracting bears by leaving his garage door open. WL544 also received an OGT report from a resident in the neighbor hood stating that 7350 Fremont place was leaving garage door open and attracting bears. 

On 10/10/2020 WL544 met the RP to talk about the incident that happened. When WL544 showed up at the residence the RP was not home. WL544 observed a cooler with blood on the top of it in the driveway. WL544 also observed at trash can that was not secure sitting next to the garage. WL544 also observed the leg of a pronghorn laying in the driveway next to the cooler. WL544 met the RP and went through the story of what happened with the bear. WL544 told the RP he needs to be better about securing attractants to make sure he is not drawing bears into his property. The RP stated that the bear was not rewarded the night it came by and had not been back to the property since but had been seen by neighbors. WL544 again told the RP to secure attractants and if the problem persisted after that to let WL544 know.

Nicholson has previously warned Barton for leaving trash and dog food out that bears were attracted to and eating. 

Nicholson and Walter responded. Nicholson observed trash and dog food as described. Nicholson observed hummingbird feeder hanging near front door. Nicholson observed observed his warning notice still posted on front of Barton’s home. 

Barton arrived at her home. Nicholson verifies her identity with WV driver license # F552625. Barton denied bears coming to her house for 2 weeks. Barton admitted she put trash outside house and dog food in back of her truck. 

Nicholson issues citation for failure to take remedial action to avoid conflict with bear. Barton said her neighbors “would regret this” and told Nicholson he would probably have to be back 10-11 times (reference to cite her for same violation). 

RP provides email voluntary statement describes bear as cinnamon color, ate in bed of truck for 45 minutes while a shined flashlight on it.

Two nights ago it got into chicken coop and ate two chickens. Coop is secured with a lock and it ripped open the wooden door and got to chickens inside. Moved chickens to  a different location on the property which appeared to be more secure but bear came back the next night 9/9 and broke off more wood to the empty chicken coop.

The on-call Officer, Rocksund (542) called the RP back. Steve was worried that the 3 bears had no fear of humans and that they where out in the middle of the day. Steve told Rocksund that the neighbor had been feeding bears carrots and sugar. Rocksund asked if Steve had reported this to CPW before and he said no, it was just common knowledge that he neighborhood knew. 
Rocksund asked Steve if they have ever had issues with bears and Steve told Rocksund that last week,  Wednesday August 12th at 10AM, his wife was chased inside by the sow and the bear ran up the porch until wife slammed door.  Steve told Rocksund that his 6year old was playing outside near the driveway and had left the garage open while outside. The sow and cubs investigated the garage a few minutes after the child went inside. Steve's wife let the dog out no knowing the bears where outside and dog barked at bears. Sow chase the dog back onto the porch with the wife standing in the door. Sow slipped on the concrete and slid across porch, unable to go through door. Wife slammed the door when sow was approximately 6' away and bear went away. 
Rocksund asked Steve to report all incident of bear activity, especially when bears are being fed. Steve said he was going to report it because the bears have become no afraid of people, but saw numerous CPW trucks where the feeder lived on Friday August 14th and thought it was taken care of. It was on August 16th that Steve witness the sow and cubs going through vehicles with no fear of humans that he wanted to report the bear's activity. 
Rocksund talked to Steve on the phone and told him to remove all attractants and keep the garage door closed; even leaving it open for a few minutes could allow these bears access. Rocksund talked to a few residence and Steve about reporting all bear activity to CPW. Rocksund told them, the community, that it was on them to eliminate all attractant and haze these bears to save the bear's lives. Rocksund reinforced them that CPW does not want to kill a bear, but would be forced to if the community cannot come together and remove attractants and shut their garage doors. 
Rocksund thanked Steve and the passerby neighbors for their time and willingness to prevent future bear conflict and keeping CPW in mind when conflict does arise.",

Received an email from the ASKCPW about a bear that has been eating RP's chickens. 
Email is as followed: ""We have lived with many bears quite successfully for a long time, but this past fall a young bear discovered our chicken coop. We lost 2 of our 12 to the bear then, and now the bear is back. We lost 2 more last Saturday and 2 more this morning. No amount of reinforcing or electrifying seems to make a difference (had a 10,000 volt, three-tiered Electric Fence that the bear went straight through this morning). We tried reducing the amount of coverage (junipers/dense tree-stands) on the hillside behind the coop as well (also as mitigation for the upcoming fire season), but the bear is still coming down the same path and getting in the run at the same spot. Our hens have supplied eggs to many high-risk mountain neighbors during these COVID-19 times and we can no longer assist them as a direct result of this bear. We have always loved bears, but this one is now posing a significant risk to our own food/assets and we cannot continue in this manner. We have applied for a hunting license this fall, but would really appreciate any advice you have in the meantime. Thank you.""

RP called to report that her house had been broken into, and her pantry had been damaged possibly by a bear. Her neighbor had been home around 1 and had not seen anything but when the RP got home around 4:30 a window had been broken and she found the damage inside the house. The RP reported that they had been seeing a bear return to the property recently but this is the first time it had done damage to the house. A bear had gotten into trash in the past but they have since built a shed for their trash cans. I recommended using bear unwelcome mats and ammonia soaked rags to add more deterrents. I also recommended rubber buck shot to  reinforce a negative experience for the bear. The RP does not know if it was the same bear. WO 525 was contacted and was unable to respond. The on call officer WO 524 was called and left a voicemail, sent a text message, and radioed. LB

WO 525’s patrol truck is in shop, and he is off duty at time of call, and leaving town for 3 days off. He is unable to respond at time of call. Entered by Nicholson.
 
Bear got into home.  Went thru open window.  Rp reported bear breaking car windo weeks prior.  Trap set.  WL 524

Kyle at the Vega Visitor's Center also provided Blanck with this information by email.  The email indicated the bear incident occurred the day before, and was not reported to Vlthe camp host until the evening of 7-19.  The camp host did not report it to the visitor center until approximately noon on 7-20.

After receiving the email,  Blanck left a voice message for Ranger Sprys asking about bear activities in the area. Sprys was on leave and did not return the call imediatley. Sprys later indicated he would keep Blanck informed. 

On 07-22-2020, DWM Blanck visited the location and spoke to campers amd staff at the nearby Vega Lodge.  None had observed any bear activity. The campers had not been spoken to by any park staff about increased bear activity in the area specifically. 

This appears to be an isolated incident, but worthy of extra vigilance in that area in the future.",

Another resident, Paula Diehl, said another resident had the bear crawl up on their second story deck and was completely unafraid of people. This is believed to be the same bear from a week earlier that was hanging around the Pinehaven area.  Trap was set on 7/10/2020 in the evening. Thompson has video of the bear, which has older, long blonde hair and new coat of darker brown coming in.  Medium to small in size.

She also stated that they have had chickens for 4 years and never had a problem.  They do not have birdfeeder, or trash out side. I advise that they need to put up electirc fenceing around coop, bear unwelcome mat around coop, to have bear pepper spray on hand as well as airhorns to haze the bear off. Husband in the back ground asked if he can shoot the bear. I replied to protect livestock or human life yes. Rp (wife) wants to speak to Officer to have trap set so this does not happen. Officer 525 was called. J.Campbell NERO

Nicholson called RP and was put in contact with her husband, Russell McCurdy. He wanted to know the law regarding protection of livestock (chickens) from depredating bears. He said a sow with 2 cubs were at his coop last night, the 2 cubs crawled over fence into pen and killed 3 chickens. He advised when he let dog out, the sow immediately ran off and the cubs were still in pen. He wanted to know if he could shoot the bears. Nicholson explained livestock exemption that allowed Russell McCurdy to shoot bears if necessary to prevent them from harming or killing livestock. Nicholson offered to meet with him and set pepper barrel. He said he would take the pepper barrel, but if bears came back he would shoot them, emphasizing he would shoot the cubs ideally since they caused the damage and the sow just watched. 

Nicholson arrived at property and met with Russell McCurdy. Nicholson walked around pen and observed scratch marks and bent wire where cubs crawled in pen. Nicholson observed scattered feathers and remains from at least 3 chickens. Nicholson set a pepper barrel and issued 3 rounds rubber buckshot to Russell McCurdy. Nicholson advised if the bears were in the chicken pen he could shoot them, but not if they were walking around the property outside the pen. Nicholson encouraged him to let the pepper barrel work and use the rubber buckshot to haze the bears. Nicholson told him to put an electric fence around pen or add hot wire to top. Russell McCurdy said he would add a hot wire. 

Russell McCurdy wanted to discuss the law allowing a person to shoot a bear in defense of people. McCurdy said the sow was on his second story deck another night. Nicholson observed two hummingbird feeders hanging from roof by deck. Nicholson advised McCurdy was required to remove all attractants after a conflict with bear, including bird feeders, trash, pet food, compost. Nicholson advised it was lawful to shoot a bear if necessary to prevent threat of injury to a person. Nicholson explained it must be abundantly clear that shooting the bear was the only option to stop the threat. Russell McCurdy advised he studied law and he would make sure his statement supported his actions (indicated that regardless of circumstances he would give a statement that justified his actions). 

In general, Russell McCurdy was argumentative and disagreeable, while making it clear he planned to kill the two bear cubs to protect his chickens. McCurdy said “any dead bears will be in the pen.” Nicholson provided his business card and instructed McCurdy to call CSP dispatch immediately to report if he shot a bear in defense of his livestock or persons. Nicholson observed McCurdy wearing a handgun and with an M14 style rifle sitting by back door. Entered by Nicholson on 8/4/2020

RP’s neighbor, Bob Burkitt, called to report a sow with three cubs that visited chicken coup. Nicholson responded and met with Trina. She observed a bear cub approach pen, pull bait bag on pepper barrel, get sprayed and then flee. All three cubs fled from area near pen and ran down draw below property with sow. Bears climbed a tree. Nicholson looked for bears and saw a cub jump out of tree and flee.  Nicholson left pepper barrel set and advised to put a hot wire on fencing around pen. Entered by Nicholson on 8/8/2020.

At that time a ""large, brown bear"" ran at him and swiped him with her paw, hitting him in his right arm, causing several cuts.  Robinowitz separated himself from the bear and then she charged a second time but did not make contact with him.  Robinowitz was able to safely get himself and his dog inside the house then had his wife drive him to the hospital where he received a couple stiches and was released.  The bear was found in the tree outside Robinowitz's back door with two cubs.  The sow was euthanized and the two cubs were relocated to a rehab center.

Officer Brown and Evert made an attempt to run the bear until the dogs began losing scent during the mid-day heat. Officer Brown photographed the goat carcass before burying it with leaves, grass, and twigs. Officer Brown and Evert then set a live action game camera on the carcass before returning later in the evening to run the bear again. Officer Brown and Evert ran two separate bears that originated from the kill sight. Officer Brown dispatched both bears once they were treed.",

RP advised bear is in area, unknown if same bear that killed chickens. Nicholson attempted to call RP, left voice message requesting call back. Entered by Nicholson on 8/10/2020.

Nicholson and Walter responded and met with RP. Dispatcher was mistaken, Bear was not still present. RP advised 10-12 chickens were killed by Bear previous night. Nicholson inspected pen, observed where bear peeled wire roof open (wire was staples to 2”x4” frame for roof). Nicholson recommended electric fence as permanent solution and explained how to reinforce roof. RP described prior Bear encounters on property for past few years (no prior depredation though). RP said they had electric fence last year, but changed their pen setup for this year and did not use electric fence.

Nicholson provides CPW brochures describing how to build electric fence for hobby livestock. Nicholson and Walter recommended bear unwelcome mat and paintball gun. RP said they would try. Nicholson advised RP should call back if they have additional problems. RP did not request game damage claim. Entered by Nicholson on 8/10/2020.",

WL 261 contacted the RP who stated that she was the camp host at a different but near by campground as was checking on the Iron City Campground every once in a while because they did not have a full time camp host for Iron City. She stated that on 07/30/2020 campers had reported seeing a large bear with ear tags (unknown color) walking threw the campground. the campers stated that the bear was not aggressive but was not bothered by humans making noise or yelling at it. The RP did not know what time the bear was seen or how often it had come back to the campground but stated that multiple campers had seen the bear.  The RP also did not know how many times the bear had gotten into campers trash at the campground but stated that there were bear boxes at the campground. The RP also stated that a new camp host would be at the campground full time starting 08/03/2020. WL 261 stated that he would mark the campground with a bear in the area sign, educated the new camp host about the bear activity, educate current campers and haze the bear if possible.  The RP stated that she had thought CPW had been informed about the incident before this, and was sorry she didn't call sooner. 

WL 261 put a bear in the area sign up in front of campground, and talked with camp host and campers. After talking to campers who were in the campground when the bear came through, they stated that the bear tried to get into the bear boxes that the campground provides to campers and was unsuccessful at getting any food and then found a cooler in an unattended campsite and got into that.",

WL 265 responded to the house on 7/3/2020 at 21:00 and spoke to the RP's daughter and the owner of the dogs.  She showed officer Holder the shed that the RP claimed the bear was trying to get into.  The door did have mark's on it but they did not appear to be scratch Mark's.  I could not see definite claw Mark's in the door that would indicate a bear was trying to get in.  The dogs the RP was worried about were very large and heavily muscled pit bulls.  These dogs were aggressive and did not appear to be afraid of anything.  The RP said the bear she saw in the trash the previous day was a small bear.  She showed me a picture and the bear is a yearling.  I would find it highly unlikely that bear would do anything in that backyard based on the size and aggressiveness of the pitbulls in the kennels.  That little bear would want nothing to do with those dogs. 
 They would almost certainly kill a bear of that size.  I gave the dog owner a Living with Bears pamphlet for further recommendations on how to minimize conflicts with bears.   I explained to her how to secure her trash with a ratchet strap and asked her to call if she had anymore problems .",

When BA  arrived WPPD Officer Mike had already cleared the house and the bear(s) were gone.  The bears were reported to have moved SW along the green belt.  The sow and cubs appear to move off when hazed but stroll through the neighborhood when not confronted.

A construction dumpster in front of the house has non-construction trash in it and about half full is the attractant.  Per Terri Collins the bears have been frequenting the dumpster attracting a crowd wanting to see the bears and take pictures.  

We spoke to several residents in the area.  They confirmed the bears are frequenting the dumpster regularly. 

Terry Collins said she was going to contact the general contractor so they can request that they don't throw non-construction trash into it.  I asked the neighbor across the street, at 1314, to call if the bears showed up again.  

Drove around the subdivision and spoke to anyone with garage doors open.  Also drove around the Northwood subdivision.


Recommendation:
Speak to the construction crew about having the dumpster dumped as it is an attractant.
Canvass the subdivision to education about being bear aware",

Wildlife 261 contacted the RP and the RP stated that she had left her house around 10:30 AM that morning and left a window to the house cracked about 2-3 inches. When she returned at 8:30 PM she noticed that the screen to the window was ripped (see image above) and the window was now open about 10-12 inches.  The RP waited till her family arrived to enter the house where she found a picture had fallen off the wall, a closet door was open where they kept dog food, and a bowl of honey was sitting outside the house. The bear had eaten both the dog food and some of the honey. The rest of the honey was poured on the ground outside the home. The RP also stated that she felt safe and did not want a response from CPW that night. Wildlife 261 informed the RP to put away all attractants and to keep the windows and doors locked that night because there was a good chance the bear would be back to finish the honey. The RP stated that she understood. Wildlife 261 then told the RP that he would be setting a trap the next day to try and catch and the bear and because the bear had broken into a dwelling the bear would have to be euthanized. The RP understood and agreed to meet with Wildlife 261 on 07/15/2020 so that Wildlife 261 could set a trap. 

On 07/15/2020 Wildlife 261 received both a call and a text from the RP stating that she wanted to refuse the trap offered by Wildlife 261. She stated she did not want the trap set on her property because she felt she could leave the windows shut and did not want the bear euthanized because it was hungry and she had left the window open.  She also informed Wildlife 261 that the bear had returned that night and ate the rest of the honey, but had not tried to get in the house. Wildlife 261 stated that he highly recommended that the trap still be set because of the potential human safety issues. The RP still refused the trap. Wildlife 261 and the RP were then able to set a time so that Wildlife 261 could perform a site inspection on the property on 07/17/2020. Wildlife 261 informed Wildlife 260 of the conversation with the RP.

On 07/17/2020 Wildlife 261 and the RP met at the RP's residence for a site inspection. The RP informed Wildlife 261 that earlier on the day of the incident she had been warming honey on the stove and had all the windows open on the house, and she felt she attracted the bear to the property that way. She showed Wildlife 261 where the bear had entered and where the different food items in the house were located. Wildlife 261 then looked around the exterior of the house and pointed out any attractants he saw and make the RP aware of them. He then educated the RP again on removing attractants and let her know that the bear may come back. The RP said she had not seen the bear since and had not seen any sign of the bear on her long walks that she takes around the property. She stated that she spoke to a retired CPW staff member who also gave her the same advise Wildlife 261 had given her, but she still didn't want the bear euthanized and therefore did not want the trap.",

I received a call from Clinton (719-396-4603) who stated that his sister is having an issue with a bear hanging around her house. She was hesitant to call because she did not want the bear euthanized. He stated that her neighbor was feeding the bear and that was the reason why the bear was hanging in the area.  I told Clinton that I would need his sister to call so that I can get specific information. 

Coleen called shortly after. She stated the following:

- The neighbors next door have been feeding the bear raw chicken
- That the bear will hang out on her back porch
- That the neighbors are very protective of the bear
- That the bear took a bag of trash out of the hands of the neighbor
- That she hasn't seen the feeding, but her other neighbor has
- That the apartment complex across the street is not being responsible with their trash

I told Coleen that I would do a site visit later today to assess the situation, figure out where to put a trap, collect any witness statements, and give a written warning to the neighbors who are feeding the bear.  I contacted WL283 for assistance.

at approximately 1330 hours, WL 283 and I went to the RP address. We talked with the RP. The RP then stated that she had not seen the neighbors feed the bear but heard it from one of the other tenants that live in the triplex.  We visited the other two tenants. They said that they had not visually seen the neighbors feeding the bears but overhead them talking about it. They also said that they had talked with the neighbors and the neighbors said not to call CPW on them.  I asked both individuals if they could write up voluntary statements and that I would visit with the neighbor. 

I talked with the neighbor and explained the issue at had. Both her and her husband were upset. They explained that they like seeing the bears but they would never feed them. They told us that they try to be as clean as possible and even store their trashcan in their garage. I explained that there were multiple complaints about the feeding and that they would be receiving a warning. They did not agree with it but understood where we were coming from. They said that two of the tenants (amber and her son) had left trash out on the street for a week and the bear kept getting into it every night. They sent pictures to back up their claims. WL 283 and I went back over and talked with the landlord. He confirmed that the trash had been ripped open by the bear that he had gotten several call from other neighbors. We made contact with Amber and gave her a written warning as well. Amber was physically and verbally upset. She claimed the other next door neighbor was feeding bears as well. We went and talked with that neighbor and he showed us that he has bolts in his trashcan to prevent the bear from getting into it. He told us that they had only been there a week and that he has lived in the area for 12 years and has never had a problem. 

I have made it clear to ALL parties that the trash needed to be cleaned up and stored properly. If there are any issues of trash or feeding, they need to have pictures or video in order to write a citation.",

RP called to report that his pheasant enclosure had been broken into and about 40 pheasants had been killed. The RP says he is sure it is a bear since he has seen them in the area before but he did not see or hear anything last night when the pheasants were killed. The pheasants are used to train his hunting dogs and falcon. Even though he has seen bears before he has not had problems with them before. I told the RP that since the bear was rewarded, it will most likely return. I told him that he should think about reinforcing the cage and setting up an electric fence and setting out bear unwelcome mats. The RP said he is too old to do anything and he just wants the bear removed. I told the RP that he can also use rags soaked in ammonia as a deterrent and to use noise to scare the bear if he sees it again. Again he said he just wanted the bear gone and requested that an officer call him back. I offered to send him education materials but he declined.

WL544 did a site visit on 07/27/2020. WL544 observes where the bear broke into the pheasant enclosure and destroyed the pheasants. WL544 then offered to set a pepper barrel with some of the pheasant carcasses. The RP thought this would be a good idea. WL544 set a pepper barrel on 07/28/2020. RP still expressed concern about the bear getting into his falcon pen. WL544 suggested using ammonia around the pen to make sure the bear is deterred from the area where falcons are kept. WL544 issued RP some rubber buckshot encase the bear is back and he can haze it away. RP was advised not to shoot bear in face or eyes and signed a release of liability form. WL544 did hand RP some education materials on how to electrify the pheasant enclosure to protect against bears. RP thanked WL544

She also informed me that the lady, Amy, has seen the bear off and on throughout the summer. 

I went to Embry's house to give her husband, Stan, rubber buckshot should the bear come back.  While there they told me Amy was at her camper trailer and suggested I go talk to her.

I went to Amy's camper trailer and spoke to her.  She told me she had bags of garbage in her car and she planned to take it to Salida the following day to get rid of it.  She told me she must have left her window cracked a little bit and  the bear then got in.  

I told her I could set a trap for the bear.  She did not want me to set a trap.

I recommended that she fix the car window as soon as possible, that she lock her doors, door on her camper and keep the camper windows closed.

Because she didn't have a shotgun I told her she could use a paintball gun and shoot the bear if it came back.  I told her to call me if it had a pattern of coming back and I would try to shoot it with rubber buckshot.",

When BA  arrived WPPD Officer Mike had already cleared the house and the bear(s) were gone.  The bears were reported to have moved SW along the green belt.  The sow and cubs appear to move off when hazed but stroll through the neighborhood when not confronted.

A construction dumpster in front of the house has non-construction trash in it and about half full is the attractant.  Per Terri Collins the bears have been frequenting the dumpster attracting a crowd wanting to see the bears and take pictures.  

We spoke to several residents in the area.  They confirmed the bears are frequenting the dumpster regularly. 

Terry Collins said she was going to contact the general contractor so they can request that they don't throw non-construction trash into it.  I asked the neighbor across the street, at 1314, to call if the bears showed up again.  

Drove around the subdivision and spoke to anyone with garage doors open.  Also drove around the Northwood subdivision.


Recommendation:
Speak to the construction crew about having the dumpster dumped as it is an attractant.
Canvass the subdivision to education about being bear aware",

Another RP, Carol Anne, called to confirm that fiends were leaving her house and hit a small bear when they swerved to avoid a much bigger bear. No party stopped  because they were scared of the sow being in the shrubs.  Rocksund told Carole Anne that officers will arrive within the hour to dispatch the bear and in the mean time nobody should approach the dying cub. Douglas County responded around 9PM and confirmed cub had succumbed to injuries and was on side of road. Cub was picked up at 9:20PM by Rocksund. Cub was approximately 65-lbs, dark brown with light muzzle, and male. Cub was assigned seal #33768. -542",

The RP backs up to open space. WL544 told her that it is not uncommon to have bears move through the area. RP said that the bear was there early in the morning and then left but came back at around 11am. The bear was just hanging out in her pond and got ahold of some fish food that they give to the fish in their pond. The bear did consume the fish food. RP said she was no longer at the address she was out for the day.

Then the phone call died. WL544 called back and left a message saying that if when they got home the bear was still there then he could come out. WL544 also texted the individual saying that often when bears are moving through they come in due to attractants. WL544 said that they should bring in these attractions like fish food that way the bear just continues to move on. If WL544 gets more information then it will be added to this report. 

Bear came back at around 2:30pm so WL544 said he would take a look. When WL544 and 549 did the site several bird feeders were observed. WL544 told the RP that she needed to remove the bird feeders and that would most likely solve the issue with the bear coming around so often.

Went to her residence and placed bear mats where the garage door meets the ground.  She didn't have a shotgun so I told her to shoot into the ground and not at the bear if the bear came back.  Told her I could issue M-80s once the fire ban is lifted.

I did not get an exact time as to when the bear was at her residence.  She smelled the bear outside of her house and could hear it, but didn't see it.",

WL 261 contacted the RP and the RP stated that she was in a tent with several children and adults and there was a bear outside the tent getting into a cooler they had left outside that contained food and beverages. The bear was between the tent and the car and the RP did not feel comfortable and wanted to get everyone into the car and asked how to scare the bear off. WL 261 informed the RP to use the panic button on her car to engage the horn and to start screaming at the bear from inside the tent to get the bear to leave. The RP did so, and the bear slowly walked off into through the campground. The RP then was able to get everyone into the car successfully. At this time the WL 261 responded to the campground and and was unable to locate the bear. WL 261 then went to the Buena Vista shop and obtained a large educational sign that warns of bears in the area and informs campers to put coolers, food and trash into locked cars. WL 261 put this sign up in the middle of the entrance and exit road to the camp ground. WL 261 then made contact with the RP and evaluated the campsite. The RP told WL 261 that the bear just got into the cooler and slowly walked off when noise was made. WL 261 educated the RP on the importance of locking up bear attractants in cars and informed her not to leave anything with a scent in their tent at night. She stated that the group was leaving that morning and would not be at the campground any longer. WL 261 then went to the camps around the area that had people outside in the early morning and informed them of the bear and gave them the same educational information that he gave the RP.  WL 261 then went to contact the camp host and found out there was no longer one at the campground. WL 262 came back to the campground later that same day and informed all campers in the campground that she could locate that there was bear activity in the area and to lock up all bear attractants when not in use.",

When I called the RP she told me the bear did just as I said it would, and got into their dog food which was outside in a pole barn next to the chicken coop in a wooden container. 

Went to the residence and looked at the damage to the coop.  The bear did not break the door, but instead tore a small piece off the bottom edge of the door.

While looking at the chicken coop the RP and her son cleaned up the remaining dog food and removed it from the pole barn.  While talking to her, she told me she looked into the cost of bins to store the food and they were around $1,500.00.  I recommended she  look for barrels with rings on Craig's List.

I left and came back with bear mats, a personally owned electric fence charger and equipment to build an electric fence.  We screwed a bear mat to the door of the chicken coop, placed a bear mat in front of the door to the chicken coop and then erected a 2-strand electric fence in front of the pole barn (where the dog food was stored) and in front of the chicken coop.  The RP has serious health issues & her son had a concussion so I helped her secure the coop and erect the fence.

Checked in with the RP on 8/16/2020.  She told me she heard the bear at the coop at around 3:30 AM, and told me their dogs were barking.  When she inspected the coop she didn't find any damage.",

6/25/2020 a dry sow was caught in a snare. It was not the target bear. The sow was darted, tagged, and relocated. The snares were reset, since the target bear was seen on trail cameras visiting the snare site the day before.

Early in the morning, a bear was walking the perimeter of the main office house where the R.P. is living.  She heard a noise in the kitchen and a bear had opened an exterior door and had gotten into the refrigerator.  The door showed no sign of forced entry, so most likely it wasn't latched.  Bear ran off when yelled at.  Report was made to S.O. and C.P.W. around 10:30 a.m.  After talking with R.P. and another staff member at the Texan, it sounds as if multiple bears are passing through the resort on a regular basis.  I instructed them to secure all attractants and really work to educate guests about what they need to do.  R.P. was not happy that I wasn't going to trap the bear that got in her kitchen.  I tried to educate her about how trapping the correct bear could be difficult due to multiple bears visiting Lake City.  Based on reports/rumor, I guess there may be upwards of 4+ different bears doing different things in town.  The staff stated they needed to get a deadbolt lock for the door the bear came through.  I also suggested the potential deployment of an electric mat to protect the door of interest  The staff of the Texan have been less than willing over the years to take minimal extra steps to ""bear-proof"" the business.",

WL283 ended up hazing the bear in a culvert that runs under Silent Rain Drive between Julynn Road and Aspen Glenn Lane. 

WL283 then went to 7259 Rising Moon Drive to talk to the residents there about feeding the bear. WL283 talked with a Dana Ahmed at that address and asked about the food. Dana said that he dropped food that he was eating for dinner as he was going outside to see what was going on. Dana said that there were kids outside and he wanted to make sure they were away from the bear that was outside. Dana said that he picked up the food afterwards. Dana said that he did not intend to give the food to the bear and knew that it was illegal to feed wildlife. I talked to Dana’s neighbor and it sounded like the original RP was not very friendly about the whole issue and that he was harassing the bear.

Officers quickly learned there was no bear attack. Officers asked what the bear did. Campers said they were concerned that it was an abandoned cub. They showed the officers the video of the bear. It was a subadult cinnamon bear with a blond Mohawk. 

The bear tried to get some food and then was scared off by the deputies. 
Officers did some bear aware education, shot off several pyrotechnics and left the area. They drove further down 314 to make sure there was no other camp with any issues. There were no other camps. 

Camp had several attractants present. The campers claimed to have just showed up a few hours before but seemed like they were transients living in the forest.

The bear moved off due North and then West to 210 Elm Street and climbed a tree approximately 20 feet up.  Bear traveled favoring its injured paw but was able to move deliberately and without stumbling.  The bear appears to be retaining body mass from when we saw it a week or so ago.  Spoke to a handyman working adjacent to the Elm property.  Notified WPPD about the bear's location.

Advised the RP to never approach the bear even to ""check"" on it.  Advised on the use of rattle cans and the importance of rattling the bear safely.  Asked RP to let us know of any sightings so we can keep tabs on the bear.",

RP is wanting rubber buck shot,because he is out of rubber bullets that he has been shooting at the bears to haze them. He stated that he went to a Bear program in Ken Caryl and was told not to use pepper spray,  to use buckets of ammonia as well as the rubber bullets.  I inquired if he had any bird feeders or dog food on deck where the bear was last night. RP stated no only flower pots. When I suggested putting down bear unwelcome mats RP stated that he has a house of glass and large opening to his deck.  RP also stated that cell service is poor at his place to please text, leave a message or just stop by.  J.Campbell NERO
Officer Olson contacted the RP and visited the residence. There are no attractants on site, and they are doing everything they can to keep the Bears at a distance from their home. A recent incident where a bear tried to go up on their deck caused further reluctance for tolerating their presence and he wanted another means to haze the bears. We also spoke about using paintballs and other motion activated sound and light devices. Also discussed laws around protecting property and living responsibly in bear country. J Olson #088",

RP said he had bought the house recently and believes the previous owner had been feeding bears. WL225 offered rubber deterrent rounds but RP didn't have a 12 gauge shotgun. WL225 provided his phone number and asked for updates.  RP called multiple times over a 3 day period while WL225 was out of town. RP said that a bear was breaking into something every single night for the past week and that he was concerned for his safety. RP said bear also broke into his vehicle which wasn't locked.  RP said he was carrying a gun and wanted to know what would happen if he shot the bear.  WL 225 called RP back on 7/15/2020 and left him a message.  WL 225 visited the address on the afternoon of 7/15/2020 but RP wasn't home or didn't answer the door.  There was an unsecured shed in the back yard with trash strewn about.  WL 225 returned the night of 7/15/2020 and noticed the shed wasn't shut or locked and the vehicle window was down. WL 225 spoke to RP by phone on 7/16/2020 and made a plan to set a trap that day. WL 225 told RP to make sure sheds were locked and windows were closed.
Bear was trapped the night of 7/16/2020-7/17/2020. Dark brown in color with lighter blonde on back and shoulders.  Bear was relocated. 
WL225 again spoke with RP about making sure vehicle windows were rolled up and doors were locked.",

The bear tips the boards off of the enclosure and goes in.  I did a site inspection and looked at the dumpster.  The dumpster is filled with fruit and food from snacks that the students don't eat during the day.  I recommended that they call Howard Disposal and have them bring a dumpster that has a lock bar on it.  I showed Sadie how to secure the lids with a ratchet strap in the meantime.  I recommended an electric fence around the enclosure that can be activated after the students leave for the day and deactivated before they arrive.  There is also evidence that raccoons are getting into the trash.  I explained that the electric fence would solve that issue as well.  I gave Sadie a ""Living With Bears"" pamphlet for further Bear Aware recommendations.  I will patrol the area at night and bean bag the bear if I see it.  Asked Sadie to call me if the bear came in during the day etc.",

We also recommended erecting an electric fence, or that he invest in electrified poultry netting to put around the trees.

In speaking with residents, they informed me that rarely were the enclosure doors closed and they’ve been unable to lock them for a period of years. Additionally, residents informed me that bears frequent the area on an annual basis. Unsure if this enclosure is largely responsible for the continued presence of bears. HOA was informed to fix and secure the dumpster enclosure. Plywood ramp was used to allow the cubs to exit the dumpster. I stayed on scene until the bears left, and used noise to haze them to a nearby creek that runs adjacent to the complex. Property management was also informed to remedy the problem in order to mitigate conflicts with bears, protect their residents and protect wildlife.",

We discussed putting ammonia in grease trap of her grill and building unwelcome mats to put by trash cans.  Bear spray also suggested.  She did ask if it could be relocated but I explained they are in bear country and he is being a bear and needs to be hazed.  Any smelly food is frozen until trash pickup.

Rangers received a call again on October 7 that the trash was once again placed out the night before.  
Officer Mckee visited on October 8.  The homeowner, Connie, Did receive the door hanger. She showed Officer McKee the door hanger and the note that she could not leave trash out overnight.  Yet, the trash went out again overnight.  Connie has current medical conditions and has a caretaker that has been taking her trash out the night before.  Officer McKee contacted her neighbor at number one red Cedar, and he stated he would help her with her trash on Wednesday mornings for pick up.  Connie was told she could not place trash out again and that she was putting her, her neighborhood, and the Bears at risk.
Connie was also told not to feed birds.  She had an empty hummingbird feeder on her porch which she asked Officer McKee to take down for her.  She stated she would not be putting the birdfeeder back out.
Connie received a written warning for failure to secure attractants.

Sheriff's deputies were on scene and said they had seen the bear but it ran away when they yelled at it, the bear later returned and ran away again after deputies yelled at it and had not been back since then.  493 attempted to locate the bear and was unsuccessful.

Krall responded and found the bear lying under a tree on the reported property.  Krall approached the bear which got up and loped off and left the property.  Bear appeared to be in good condition and no odd behavior.

While Krall was talking to the RP the bear returned and began going in a large circle.  It completed the same circle in the same path at least a dozen times.  Bear seemed alert with no vision issues.  Krall recorded a video of the bear and sent the video to Karen Fox, Mary the new vet, and supervisor Mike Trujillo.  While waiting for feedback from Fox and the vet, Krall called Trujillo.  Trujillo told Krall to kill the bear.  He did not ask any further questions.  As Krall was about to euthanize the bear the vet responded that based on the video, she did not believe the bear had any neurological or disease issues.  The vet suggested that it may be a sow that had lost her cubs based on the behavior.  Krall asked her advice on Tranquilizer vs euthanize.  She recommended tranquilizer but said ultimately it was Krall’s decision. 

Krall called Trujillo, who allowed Krall to tranquilizer the bear.  Krall darted the bear at 10 yards using 2cc of Nalmed from bottle 2019-04-11.  The bear was immobilized in about 5 minutes.

Krall inspected the bear which showed no obvious signs of injuries or disease.  The bear was lactating.  The bears age appeared to be about 4-6, closer to 4.  Body condition was fair.  No cubs had been seen in the area for two days, but a sow and two cubs had been reported in the area earlier.  There were no reports of the sow and Cubs causing problems, just sightings.

Krall called Trujillo and asked if he could tag and release on site.  Trujillo said I could release on site, but not to tag or make a report.  Krall asked how to account for 2cc of drug and policy.  Trujillo allowed Krall to use white ear tags (SE 384), since no issues with bear.  Krall gave the bear 4cc atemeprozol and after a bit of time the bear wandered of.  As of 06/24 the bear has not returned.  Krall did a thorough search of the property and could not find any sign of cubs.  

On 06/21 Krall met with Trujillo in Westcliffe to get a taser.  Trujillo told Krall that he had seen that behavior many times in animals that lost their young.",

RP called to report possible bear activity. Last night, his dogs were barking but he did not know why. This morning, he found his bee hives knocked over. The RP was calling to ask what we would do when he shot it. The bee hives are a hobby for the RP and he did not have the hives fenced off or protected in any way. This is the first time any sort of bear activity has occurred  on his property. I recommended using deterrents to ward off the bear and reminded him if the hive is unprotected, the bear will continue to be rewarded. I recommended setting up an electric fence and using ammonia as a scent deterrent. I also recommended setting up motion lights so that he can see the hives at night and to use noise to haze the bear in the future. I also recommended using rubber buck shot if the bear comes back. I reminded him that he wants to scare the bear and that by using negative reinforcement it will associate people with the bad experience and avoid interactions in the future. The RP refused education materials because he ""has lived there for 12 years and knows what to do"".  LB
Officer Olson called and discussed with the RP the laws pertaining to when a bear can be legally removed for causing damage and offered to drop by some rubber buckshot for hazing. Officer Olson stopped by the residence later that afternoon and issued some rubber buckshot and discussed the situation further. The RP has no other obvious attractants on his property.

Items covered:
1. Majority of the lids are broken on bear proof dumpster making it ineffective. It needs to be fixed.
2. In the interim, chains or cables need to be used in combination with a come-along to tightly close lids.
3. Electric fencing was discussed, and construction options using existing enclosure was also discussed.
4. Potential fines for inaction were covered, and how DWM Gallegos would much rather Ramon’s put money into improving their enclosure instead of paying fines.
They were very receptive, and agreed to implement these recommendations.",

WL 261 contacted the RP and the RP stated that a bear had been to campsite three times that night and had got into his cooler and trash that he had outside. He stated that the bear started coming into camp at 3:00 AM and come back two other times by 3:30 AM. WL 261 instructed the the RP to collect his trash and food and lock them into his vehicle and remove anything that had a scent from the tent and lock that up as well. The RP informed WL 261 that he did not feel comfortable going outside to collect the trash and food, and did not have a car to lock the food and trash in. The RP stated all he had was a mountain bike. WL 261 informed the RP to make as much noise as possible if the bear came back, and informed the RP that WL 261 would be making a site visit as soon as he got ready. The RP stated that he understood.  As WL 261 was getting ready the bear returned. WL 261 arrived on scene and could not find the bear. WL 261 contacted the RP who was outside his tent. WL 261 informed the RP to collect the trash and food and put it as far away from his tent as possible in case the bear came back, since the RP had no way of securing it. The RP agreed and did so. He also informed the RP to remove any thing with a scent from the tent which the RP stated he already had. WL 261 walked the river bank an approximate 200 yards from the tent in the direction the RP stated the bear had went and found food wraps and bear scat but no bear. WL 261 educated the RP on the importance of putting bear attractants away or in a tree at night and he understood, he also told the RP to make a lot of noise if the bear came back with pots and pans which the RP had. WL 261 also informed the RP to contact him if the bear came back that night. The RP stated that he would be leaving in the morning and would not be staying another night in the same location.",

RP said a bear was consistently getting into their trash and they had a dumpster with a locking bar and plastic lid. RP said bear was becoming more aggressive because since they started taking their trash off site it started coming close to their vehicle and left a paw print on the window. WL544 offered to come out and take a look but suggested that he remove any attractants that were possibly bringing bear in. 

On August 8th WL544 did a site visit. RP said that they were not having any more issues since they started taking the trash to another location and making sure there were not any attractants. RP said that they did have a freezer full of meat in the barn but they kept the door closed and a radio on. WL544 did not observe any attractants on the property and it was clean with little trash. WL544 let the RP know that if he started having issues again to let WL544 know.

RP was woken up at 4:30am Saturday to his chickens screaming. He and his dog went outside and saw a bear in the coop actively eating his chickens. The RP's dog  started barking and running at the bear and the bear charged the dog. RP and dog ran back into the house and closed the door. RP s stated the bear was on his porch and after 10 minutes it ran west off the property. The house is right off of Memmen Open Space where the bear came from. 

WLO 549 was notified on Sunday 10/4 of the incident and called RP back. 549 stated that the chickens and other attractants like trash brought the bear into the yard and that the RP would need to bear proof the house and chicken coop. 549 asked if the bear was trying to get into the house, the RP stated that it was not. 549 suggested electric fencing, ammonia soaked rags and a radio on inside the coop. RP wanted CPW to relocate the bear. 549 told RP that he lives in bear habitat and that he would be dealing with bears as long as he has attractants so removing the bear would not fix his problem. 549 told RP that he had the right to shoot the bear if it was actively attacking his chickens as long as he lives in unincorporated Douglas County and there were no firearm restrictions. 549 also offered to do a site visit and RP agreed. 

The next day (10/5), WLO 549 went to 232 Ash Ave for a site visit. She noticed that the trash was out and that they had not cleaned the backyard up from the other night. 549 took photos of the yard and damage (see attached photos). 549 told RP to secure the coop and maybe put electric fencing on the border fence, she also mentioned un-welcome mats and ammonia soaked rags along the fence. RP mentioned he and his wife moved there in February from Texas and was not familiar with living in bear country. 549 asked RP if he wanted education material on  how to bear proof his property and he was interested in that offer. 549 sent bear proof/ education material to RP's email.

I know the RP and have worked with him regarding bear problems in the past. 

The RP told me some people living in a camper trailer on the farm left their car window unrolled and a bear got into the car.  He told me there were beverages in the car and the bear got into them.  

RP also told me one of the tenants told him a bear got into their chickens.  I asked him if it was anytime soon and he told me it was not.  I told him to have the tenant who farms call me and I could give information on how to better secure the coop.  I recommended electric fence. and electrified poultry netting.

The RP was good with allowing bear hunters on the property . That evening I made contact with two bear hunters (Ves and Chance Gulliford) and contacted another two (Trish and Ray Morishini) the following day.  The hunters were going to contact Ring to try to harvest the bear.

Drove past the farm which is surrounded by 10' high fencing on 9/19/2020 to see if the tenants who raise the chickens and turkeys was there.  The gate  to the farm was closed and I did not see anyone.  As of 9/19/2020 the  tenants who have the chickens and farm animals haven't called.",

Officers McKee and Dodd were patrolling in the Rainbow Falls area off of County Road 49 that evening. Saw a black bear, brown in color approximately 200 pounds, Marauding through an unattended campsite.  A UTV trailer had been left open and trash and all camp food had been left unattended in camp.  Officers hazed the bear by yelling and use of a bean bag round.  Camping in bear country brochures were provided to campers along that stretch.  Information and a notice was left at the campsite by Officer Dodd.  On the way out, officers ran into the parties associated with that camp. They stated they would clean everything up and that they were heading out that evening (maroon Chevy occupied by five CLP552)
Officer Mckee contacted Fanta with US forest service. He was made aware of the situation and was going to contact other USFS  employees that cover that area so all parties could keep an eye out.

LITTLETON CO 80127

On, 08/08/2020, I, Wildlife Officer Scott Murdoch, was on routine patrol along the Khuester Rd.  While on patrol, I drove down North Trail Circle to talk with landowners that live along the road.  I occasionally meet with these landowners to continue a positive relationship with them and CPW.  

While patrolling, I pulled into the address of 13854 North Trail Circle, (see above owner and parcel ID).  This address belongs to Russell (Rusty) W. Andrews (04/13/1958) CID:186200051.  I pulled into the driveway (Photo 1) and near the cabin observed a wood board covered in corn, birdseed, watermelon, a bucket of grease, and a tin of dog food (Photos 2-4).  It was clear that the food was left to intentionally feed bears.  I looked up Andrews on the Colorado Parks and Wildlife License database and he did not have any bear hunting licenses for 2020.  I also obtained Andrews phone number ((303) 944-4953).

While at the property there was a female with 2 children.  I spoke to her and she said Rusty was not there.  I asked if he was going to be by soon.  She said perhaps tomorrow.

Later, at approximately 5:02 pm on 8/8/2020, I called Andrews and left him a message asking him to call me back.  At 9:27 am on 8/9/2020, I received a call from Andrews.  I recognized his voice as Andrews.  I informed him that I found his pile of food that he had been leaving out for the bears.  I informed him that he cannot intentionally feed bears.  I gave him a verbal warning (warning required for the initial violation as required by statute) for violation of 33-6-131 CRS as amended:  Did knowingly and unlawfully place food in the open with the intent of luring a wild bear to such food.  

Andrews acknowledged that it was not a good idea to feed the bears and understood the changes that feeding results in with bear behavior.  I asked Andrews if he was planning on hunting over the bait.  Andrews said that he has chased wildlife all over the hills in the past and he has wounded animals and was hoping by baiting that he wouldn't wound a bear if it came in.  I explained the bear-baiting statutes and the stiff consequences if he continued his behavior.  He said he would remove the bait.  I asked if there was any more around his property.  He said no.

This has been entered into CrimeIntel also.  Case 087-04-2020 Officer Scott Murdoch.",

RP has had the bears at the residence 4 nights in a row around 10p-midnight. Bears are a possible family unit, 1 large black bear, 2 smaller light brown bears approx. the size of Labrador retrievers.  Bears have gotten into septic tanks on multiple occasions, broke into a ""temporary"" window on a vehicle, tested the door handle on a second vehicle but didn't enter either vehicle.  Bears have eaten citronella candles on patio,  removed screen and partially opened small ground level window into water softener room. RP has hummingbird feeders that were also hit on the first visit. Feeders are taken in at night and RP encouraged to remove them completely.   RP has encountered bears on the patio 10 ft from the door to the house  and has run them off by yelling at them and acting aggressively toward them. 

Others in the valley have had bear issues but do not call trying to protect the bears. RP has lived in the valley for just under 1 year. RP asked about when it is legal to shoot a bear but suggested that was a last resort. RP understood that relocation is highly likely to fail. RP was given information about establishing his ""territory"" with the bears but that bears will persist in the environment around his home. 

Unwelcome mats, motion detector with a radio, electric fencing, rubber buck and a pepper barrel are all planned to attempt to realign bear behavior.",

Ken Caryl Ranger, Matt Oven, responded as CPW  officers were on another call.  Homeowners had left vehicles unlocked and had a backpack full of granola bars. The bear got into the vehicle pulled out the backpack and pulled it down the street where it ate food out of the pack. No damage was on the vehicle.  Homeowners were advised to keep all attractants out of the vehicle and to lock their vehicles.  Homeowners had also had bears in  trash a few times over the last couple weeks. They were advised to keep all trash locked.  
Education material is sent out to Ken Caryl residents every year.  
In addition, on July 7, 2020 an educational blast went out to this neighborhood that included a next-door posting, local Ken Caryl media sites, their local Facebook, and their e-news.  This release specifically talked about removing all trash cans until morning of pick up and removing all valuables from cars and locking them up.
A bear packet will be mailed directly to this homeowner on Monday.

They also advised that they had a Mineral County Deputy in route. DWM Gallegos called the RP en route to advise that he was on his way. Once there the RP told DWM Gallegos that he had a bear get into his trash the previous night. He loaded his 45 Long Colt lever action rifle in case the bear tried to get in his house. The bear ended up leaving. The following morning he picked up his trash can and put it in his shed. Early on the morning of the 24th he heard a noise in the living room, which is adjacent to his bedroom. He grabbed his rifle, and found the bear in his living room. He fired a total of 9 times, killing the bear with a shot to the head on his last shot. He then called 911. The bear had entered through what appeared to be an open window. An additional open window was found over the kitchen table. The bear was removed from the house by the Deputy and DWM Gallegos. Mr. Williams was advised that he was within his legal right to protect life at that point, and satisfied the notification requirement, so no laws were broken. He was advised that they needed to adapt to living in bear country when they came out to Colorado, by not waiting until the bear got their trash to store it properly and shut windows at night. A “Living with Bears” brochure was given to him.",

He did not encounter the bear on this occasion, just heard it.  RP then encountered bear sunday (7/19) in which he found the bear in the garbage cans in the front driveway and RP chased the bear across the road.  He sprayed trash cans with ammonia following this encounter.  The bear came back 2 hours later and got back into the trash cans. RP chased it off. The bear then came back a third time 1 hour later and got back into the trash cans.
 The bear came back around 4:30AM on Monday (7/20) and got back into the trash cans. This time the RP used rubber shotgun shells and discharged one at the bear, hitting it. The bear came back a final time on Monday (7/20) in the evening and got back into the trash. RP chased it off and the bear headed west. Bear was described as 4 feet tall, black, without tags. 

RP requested call back. Requested more rubber shotgun bullets.

On 07/30 RP talked with officer McArdle, reporting the bear got into the laundry room of his house and took a 50 lb bag of dog food.
This happened in the late evening of 07/29.
McArdle went to the residence and set a live trap on 7/30",

I went to the Manor RV park campsite #80 to speak to the victim, Howard Terkins (DOB 03/20/1956), and investigate. The victim said he heard a noise near his truck  between 4:30-5am. He exited his camper and a bear charged him, knocking him on the ground and scratched him on his chest and stomach. The bear was described as large and brown in color. The victim did not report the incident to authorities. Upon investigation of the scene, victim left a bag of dog food in the bed of his truck that the bear was getting into. There was also a paw print on the truck that was a size consistent to a cub. I spoke with the Manor RV general manager and recommended a trap to be set and they declined. Advised the victim and the Manor RV employees. One employee said a brown sow with two black cubs have been frequenting the rv park.",

The bear did not get into the garage. WL283 talked with the RP about how to take care of their trash and attractants. The house is a vacation home that gets rented out over the summer. The RP/homeowner is very adamant that all in coming guests will freeze trash and keep up all food sources so there are no more food conflicts. 

WL283 did a site visit and WL287 brought up a bear trap. RP’s did not get a look at the bear. WL 283 found 3 bear hairs with a brown color. WL283 would guess that the bear was about 200 lbs based on the paw prints on the garage door. Any bear caught would be relocated.

 Bear was caught and relocated.",

Officer Mckee had received information from a third-party that a bear had been seen in Marilyns  yard and they believed she had attractants .  Officer Mckee made a site inspection on September 9. Marilyn had nothing in her yard and stated she does not feed birds or leave her trash out. She also stated she never puts anything additional in her yard that could potentially attract bears or other wildlife.

The bear is a medium sized bear that will be a very dark brown or black colored bear.,

WL 261 contacted the RP who stated that she was the camp host at a different but near by campground as was checking on the Iron City Campground every once in a while because they did not have a full time camp host for Iron City. She stated that on 07/30/2020 campers had reported seeing a large bear with ear tags (unknown color) walking threw the campground. the campers stated that the bear was not aggressive but was not bothered by humans making noise or yelling at it. The RP did not know what time the bear was seen or how often it had come back to the campground but stated that multiple campers had seen the bear.  The RP also did not know how many times the bear had gotten into campers trash at the campground but stated that there were bear boxes at the campground. The RP also stated that a new camp host would be at the campground full time starting 08/03/2020. WL 261 stated that he would mark the campground with a bear in the area sign, educated the new camp host about the bear activity, educate current campers and haze the bear if possible.  The RP stated that she had thought CPW had been informed about the incident before this, and was sorry she didn't call sooner. 

WL 261 put a bear in the area sign up in front of campground, and talked with camp host and campers. After talking to campers who were in the campground when the bear came through, they stated that the bear tried to get into the bear boxes that the campground provides to campers and was unsuccessful at getting any food and then found a cooler in an unattended campsite and got into that.

On 08/08/2020 the RP (new camp host of Iron City) called and let WL 261 know that the night before at about 8:30 PM a bear came back into camp and walked within 30 yards of a large group of campers at site 15. After yelling and and throwing sticks at the bear it finally walked away. Later that night at about 2:30 AM a bear returned to site 15 again and got into a cooler filled with ice that the campers had left out and a black container that had cooking utensils in it. WL 261 and WL 264 responded to the campground that day and spoke with the RP as well as every camp site that had occupants in the campground and educated them on the importance of using the bear boxes provided by the camp ground to store coolers and food of any kind. The sign that was dropped off at the last incident remained up at the front of the campground.",

Upon arrival the carcass was heavily scavenged, with bear scat throughout the area. The carcass is located within a high fenced domestic elk enclosure occupied by approximately 150 additional elk cows who are preparing to calf. Mary is worried about possible future predation on the calves. 

Trap set on 5/27/20
Trap pulled on 6/1/20
Trap was unsuccessful. No further predation or sighting had occured so 442 supplied Mary Porter with a game damage packet for her alternative livestock, was instructed to call 442 immediately if bear returned, and informed of her right to defend her livestock from active predation.

End of incident at this time.",
